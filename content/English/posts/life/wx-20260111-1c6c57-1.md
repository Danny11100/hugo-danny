description: "Whether something is worth your time is never about how fancy it sounds, but whether it truly creates leverage."

A friend joked recently:

“On WeChat, there are more people writing than people reading.”

It sounds like a meme, but it isn’t that far off.

There is more and more content, yet what gets read, trusted, and remembered keeps shrinking.

In that context, I put writing, trading, and “leverage” on the same table again.

Many people believe writing as a KOL can make money,
like believing that a Chinese‑lit degree makes you a writer.

Many people believe that studying trading leads to financial freedom,
like believing a finance major makes you a market shark.

But whether something is worth doing
isn’t about how sophisticated it sounds,
it’s about whether it truly creates leverage.

---

Salaried work is piece‑rate pay in disguise. It doesn’t create leverage.

Trading with your own capital and “scaling up” is, in most cases, an illusion.

Only inside institutions and systems
does leverage truly exist.

For years, “media” and “code” were pitched as leverage for ordinary people (Naval’s Almanack).
In the early dividend years, that wasn’t entirely wrong.
Code did allow value to be copied at low marginal cost,
and self‑media once did amplify individual influence.

But the problem is:

**Leverage has a time window.**

When writing becomes standardized labor,
when revenue depends on how many ads you take,
when creation feels like submitting tasks to a platform,
then it’s no longer leverage.
It’s just another form of wage work.

Now the same story is replaying with AI.
AI is called the next big opportunity,
so we see endless content teaching AI, talking about AI, sharing AI.

But if it’s only glanced at, liked, and forgotten,
if it doesn’t enter decisions or earn trust,
then it’s a short‑term dividend, not long‑term leverage.

---

So one thing is becoming clear to me:

**Writing for the public**
**and writing for decision‑makers**
**are two completely different things.**

The first solves for exposure.
The second solves for adoption.

Following that logic, I’ve realized that for most knowledge workers,
**writing slides (PPT) is also a form of writing**—
not for beauty,
but to explain complex problems clearly in limited time and influence judgment.

Digital nomads, KOLs, independent traders, creators, AI bloggers…
These “free” identities are often just different labels for gig work.
In good markets you don’t notice the difference;
in bad markets the cracks show instantly.

---

A simple ending:

**The hardest part isn’t choosing a road.**
**It’s being honest with yourself.**

Some choices are packaged as new and cool,
but reality won’t be kinder just because you’re young,
or because you caught a trend.
