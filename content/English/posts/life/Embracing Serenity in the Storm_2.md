### Embarking on a Journey of Self-Discovery
Now, let’s delve deeper into my Vipassana journey. I applied for some time off, flew to a different city, and ventured to an obscure mountain with my luggage in tow. Opting to hike to the summit instead of taking a bus, I felt my journey had truly begun with that choice. Upon arrival, I noticed I was among the youngest attendees; surrounded mostly by individuals who could be uncles and aunts. Their surprise was palpable — perhaps, from their vantage point, a young man like me shouldn’t be burdened by significant troubles. Yet, it was curiosity more than anxiety that propelled me forward. I saw this as a cool adventure and a potential release from work stress.

### The Art of Letting Go
Upon arrival, we were required to surrender all our belongings to the organization, including cash and mobile phones. I joked to myself that if I were to be kidnapped, no one would know. Thankfully, this was an official and trustworthy organization. With the retreat starting the next day, our first evening involved watching a documentary on Vipassana before retiring early at 9 p.m.

### A Day of New Beginnings
The regimen for the next ten days was stringent, spanning from 4 a.m. to 9 p.m., a schedule unheard of in bustling city life. Unsurprisingly, my first night was restless, attributed to this sudden lifestyle shift and the anticipation of the days ahead.

On Day 1, I rose at 4:00 a.m. and embarked on my first prolonged session of cross-legged meditation. The unfamiliarity made it challenging to maintain focus on my breathing. Persevering through two hours led to a welcome breakfast break, featuring an array of delicious vegetarian dishes. The day continued in this pattern: meditate, eat, meditate, with each session proving more monotonous than I’d anticipated. Had I known the extent of the repetition, my initial enthusiasm might have waned. Yet, my resolve to complete what I had started kept me anchored.

### Lessons in Mindfulness and Impermanence
Despite the time that has elapsed since the retreat, the memory of leg pain and discomfort lingers vividly. That first day was a relentless cycle of redirecting my wandering mind back to my breath, interspersed with intrusive thoughts about work and life. The instructor’s advice was clear: leave external concerns outside and focus solely on breathing.

The essence of Vipassana became clearer when physical discomfort from prolonged sitting arose. Rather than succumbing to irritation, I learned to observe the pain without reaction, understanding that it, too, would pass. Similarly, fleeting moments of comfort or focus weren’t to be celebrated but observed with the same detachment, embodying the principle that all experiences, pleasant or unpleasant, are transient.
