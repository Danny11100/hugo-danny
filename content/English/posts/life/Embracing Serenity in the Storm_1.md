Today, I’m drawn to recount an experience steeped in tranquility and introspection: my ten-day Vipassana retreat in a quaint temple nestled within China’s serene landscape back in 2017. At that juncture, freshly embarking on my career, I was grappling with life’s profound questions. These ruminations have resurfaced, echoing the present day as I confront a spate of lukewarm responses to my job applications across Europe and the fatigue of cultural assimilation. Amidst this, I recognize an acute need for stillness, self-reflection, and a constructive approach to life’s hurdles. Vipassana has, once again, become my sanctuary.

### Navigating the Job Market’s Choppy Waters
In my quest for growth, I’ve found myself ensnared in a conundrum, having cast a wide net for product manager roles throughout Europe—primarily in Germany and the Netherlands. Regrettably, invitations to interview are rare, and on the occasion they do arise, the specter of visa issues often leads to doors closing. It’s a rational preference, from a corporate standpoint, to opt for local talent, particularly in roles demanding an intimate comprehension of user behaviors and preferences in order to sculpt features that resonate deeply.

Nevertheless, these setbacks have not quelled my spirit. Each interview serves as a crucible for personal and professional refinement. My perseverance harks back to the days of Vipassana.

### The Art of Stillness Amidst the Noise
The essence of Vipassana transcends borders, with myriad interpretations around the globe. At its core, “super-seeing” defines it, yet most embrace it as a pathway to “insight” or “clear-seeing”—a journey inward rather than an examination of our external reality. Its parallels with meditation are uncanny; both are bastions of focus and serenity. I’ve come to regard it as ‘the art of stillness.’ Embracing Vipassana means forgoing the digital chatter of modernity for contemplation; a world where silence reigns, and the rhythm of one’s breath becomes the sole focus, devoid of even the most transient of eye contacts. This is the practice of severing ties with the tumult of the external world to delve into the self.

### A Glimpse of Vipassana: The Beginning of a Journey
Fast forward a year, and I found myself in a startup’s dynamic crucible, though the winds of change were tapering off, with competition outpacing us. Once ordered, our management descended into disarray. As a junior product manager, I was privy to the CEO’s vision—initiatives that seemed potent at inception. Yet, I pondered if our trajectory truly aligned with our user’s desires or merely mirrored executive conjecture. Caught between acquiescence and skepticism, I sought clarity through Vipassana, compelling me to apply for leave. In an unexpected gesture, my CEO bestowed upon me a Buddhist sutra—a harbinger of the introspective journey ahead.

Admitting to a flicker of skepticism—courtesy of their antiquated online presence—I decided to lean into the unfamiliar, spurred by a youthful zest for transformative experiences that promised an escape from the ennui of routine.
