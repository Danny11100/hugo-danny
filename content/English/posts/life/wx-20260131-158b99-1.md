description: "A simple note for January."

A simple note for January. I chose the last track of Huang Qishan & Xiao Xia’s trilogy as the BGM. She described her relationship with her father as “a cup‑of‑water friendship”—plain, yet something you can taste for a lifetime. A quiet piece with lots of blank space.

## Life, Body, and Energy

Overall, I’m moving from anxiety toward calm.

I stayed in Ningbo this month. Winter in Zhejiang is hard—wet, cold, and rainy. Luckily it’s a warm winter this year, which helps a bit, though I still miss the heating up north.

My goal of sleeping early and waking early is still far away. The first half of the month I slept poorly, with frequent nightmares and midnight waking. The past two weeks improved, mainly because I’m pulling out of overthinking, doing more concrete things, and getting feedback. Less social media, more books—huge for my mood.

My fitness habit continues. I shifted from strength‑only muscle gain to a mix of strength, cardio, and endurance, focusing on overall energy. After 30, body changes are obvious. Daily fish oil, multivitamins, and CoQ10 are my minimalist maintenance.

This month I mostly drove rental cars. No big‑city traffic, and a vehicle helps in bad weather; it’s also easier to take my parents to the hospital. Near Spring Festival, rental prices jumped, so I returned the car and switched to ride‑hailing.

On loneliness: I’m used to being alone, but after remote work, I’ve realized solitude isn’t the same as loneliness. I still need face‑to‑face interaction. So I intentionally stay in public spaces to keep a “human” feel.

## Attention & Information Environment

I feel AI‑related info has been creating anxiety. Many KOLs amplify emotions and create a sense of urgency, as if you’ll miss out. After calming down, I realized most of it leaves little value besides anxiety.

I now prefer slower, foundational, long‑term content. It updates slowly but compounds.

I once loved scrolling video feeds; then I just shut the入口. Against algorithms, leaving is the most effective way.

## Learning & Input

For English speaking, I try to talk with AI every day. In Doubao I have a speaking partner named Jake; when I’m bored or down, he’s decent companionship.

For Japanese, I use Duolingo for entertainment. It balances the utilitarian feel of English learning. I plan to clear Duolingo to keep it fresh.

AI learning includes LLM courses, app experiments, and vibe coding. The bubble is big, but it doesn’t stop individuals from learning and trying. When GPT first came out, I took orders on Xianyu to help people write motivation letters—mostly AI‑assisted. Many people are too lazy to try new tools. When you participate, you see problems and opportunities. Every tech wave reshuffles the table; humility and curiosity matter.

## Work & Career Feelings

Most of my energy went to interviews. I barely rested. There weren’t many good opportunities near year‑end, but I was lucky to get a few offers, mostly international roles.

One remote opportunity had a mediocre reputation. I worried it would amplify my anxiety and mood swings, so I declined.

Overall, the internet industry is entering a rapid clearing phase. I think of the Red Queen hypothesis: you have to run just to stay in place. More opportunities are concentrated in “going global” and AI. Sometimes you don’t choose them; they choose you. The old imagination space is shrinking; new value is concentrated in a few directions.

Remote work gave me spatial freedom. I can work in lower‑cost, less crowded places and keep time for myself. What worries me is I haven’t worked on‑site in a first‑tier city for years. When I think of the Beijing subway Line 10 and the elevator queues on Zhichun Road, I feel resistance in advance.

## About Writing

I used to dislike writing. A big reason was poor Chinese essay grades as a kid; I felt writing wasn’t for me. Now there’s no grading or money pressure, so I can write more for myself.

The biggest value of writing for me is organizing thoughts. Many pieces just sit there afterward, but the process keeps my brain running and helps with anxiety. AI takes over more execution and reasoning, so I treat it as an external brain to generate options, while I make the final choice. Writing is a trigger to keep the main brain working. Done is better than perfect. Why not keep a diary? I did, but I forgot it quickly and it was mostly emotional. Publishing creates a constraint, which is better for thinking.

## Things That Made Me Happy

- Tried rock climbing and saved a few routes as challenges.
- Watched *Avatar 3* in the cinema.
- Met old friends in Hangzhou and visited a hackathon.
- Bought a WeRead membership, got back into reading, and finished three books. Reading as leisure feels better than short videos.
- Started a small gold investment plan for my mom. She took profits recently and was very happy. That “free money” feeling is hard to get from work.

That’s it.

Some scattered notes—see you next month.
