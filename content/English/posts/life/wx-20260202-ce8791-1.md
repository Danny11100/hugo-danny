description: "Three small things that made me happy—sending a little positive energy to the universe."
---

Markets have been quite a pullback lately.

Gold and silver had sharp single‑day drops, the Korean stock market hit a circuit breaker, and Bitcoin fell toward $75,000.

Last week I was saying “build a base.” This week my brain kept shouting: can I just get my principal back and stop playing?

Hold and build. Bear markets are for rest, learning, and building—doing things that make you happy. Economies have cycles, and so does life.

I felt a bit down today.

Still, I want to record three small things that made me happy and send a little positive energy to the universe.

## 1) Hiring a Full‑House Cleaner for My Parents

Before Spring Festival, my mom usually cleans the house by herself. I took a look and it was messy, so I hired a cleaner via Xianyu.

It was about 60+ RMB per hour, two people, nine hours total. Close to Beijing prices during holiday season. It’s called “full‑house cleaning,” but it’s more surface‑level; still much cleaner than doing it ourselves, and at least my mom could rest.

She said she could do it, but who would refuse a break?

The cleaner asked if I was preparing for marriage. I said, it’s just a New‑Year cleaning—what does that have to do with marriage?!

## 2) Qwen Customer Support

Last night I spent hours tinkering with openclaw. I connected it to a Telegram bot and sent it to a community. The model was Alibaba Qwen Max. After the free quota ran out, I tried switching models, but the Tencent Cloud deployment seemed to support only one model, so I went back to Qwen.

I recharged and bought a resource pack. This morning the account showed arrears. My first thought: what did this agent do behind my back?

I fed the logs to GPT; it amplified the risk and made me even more anxious. (GPT has been extra “dog‑like” lately—over‑pleasing instead of solving the problem.)

After calming down, I checked and found the resource pack was still there; only the balance had been cleared.

I contacted Qwen support. The first agent was vague and asked me to recharge; I did, and immediately got another arrears alert.

The second time, support called me directly, corrected the earlier explanation, and carefully explained the model mechanism, context protocol, and how input/output tokens are billed.

That moment really moved me. People who take their work seriously shine. They even transferred me to an engineer who explained in detail. The conclusion: the resource pack covers output, but the big cost is context and memory, which is charged to the account balance.

A transparent, direct conversation added light to an otherwise gloomy day.

*(BTW, I really want to use a better model for the agent, make it smarter. But openclaw’s memory/context costs are brutal. Sometimes I’m afraid it will go offline or forget our chats. A self‑built agent just feels more emotional than a purchased one.)*

## 3) Evening Walk With My Mom

My gym card expired, so I went home and dragged my mom out for a walk. We hadn’t walked together in a long time. Her first comment: the cleaner made the windows so clean.

We walked around the nearby school—parents were driving to pick up kids. By the river, rows of dark villas waited for buyers; it felt unreal.

A world map hangs at home; I bought it two years ago. I told them: when you miss me, find where I am—though it’s tiny and hard to spot.

Today my mom said the map doesn’t seem useful anymore.

I said, keep it. Sometimes looking at it brings new perspective.

I looked at it for a while and suddenly realized: the world really is big.
