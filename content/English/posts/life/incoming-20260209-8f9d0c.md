I sat in a cafe all day today.
The background music was the kind of repetitive pop tracks that keep looping on short-video platforms. I kept switching between songs, chatting with AI, comparing model outputs, and adding more context again and again, as if I were waiting for a better answer to appear. It was not exactly irritation, more like a light numbness: as long as I kept inputting things, I could maintain the illusion that I was still moving forward.

Then a surging melody cut through everything.
I looked down and saw it was the fourth movement of Dvorak's Symphony No. 9, *From the New World*.

I do not really understand classical music, but the effect was immediate. It felt like something opened inside me. The space became brighter, and some of the heaviness in my body loosened. It did not carry the oppressive force of Beethoven's *Fate* Symphony, nor did it push me toward confrontation. It felt more like being gently led away from where I had been stuck.

I continued and listened to the full symphony.
I chose the Karajan recording and did nothing else from beginning to end. I just sat and listened. The whole experience felt like a complete emotional curve: expansion, restraint, and then a stable return.

The first movement opens wide, like standing on unfamiliar ground, excited but also slightly uneasy.

The second movement slows everything down. The melody carries a sense of farewell, lyrical and melancholy, with restrained sorrow underneath. Near the end, the emotion no longer pushes forward; it circles in place. At that moment I suddenly thought of my working years in Beijing. Now I sit at home, surrounded by things so familiar they almost feel unchanged forever. Yet once you are far away, the details you ignored become unexpectedly clear.

The third movement is rhythmic and energetic, with a dance-like pulse mixed with something primitive, as if compressing the noise of a new world into music.

The final movement gathers earlier themes one by one, like coming back after a long detour and finally understanding what you want to carry with you.

Later I checked the background and learned that Dvorak wrote this work during his time in New York. The prosperity of the New World and the complexity of immigrant culture kept pulling him into contrast with his distant Czech homeland. He drew rhythmic and modal traits from African American spirituals and Native American music without directly quoting melodies. The solo in the second movement feels like homesickness with nowhere to settle.

Two emotional lines run in parallel through the symphony:
one is an observation of the new world,
the other is attachment to where one came from.

Today, when humans can go to space and technology is this advanced, what moved me most was still music written more than a century ago.

Short videos fill attention with instant gratification. AI reduces the friction of thinking with intelligence and companionship. In comparison, this kind of music promises nothing and does not try to change you. It simply stays with you quietly and brings your attention back to yourself, little by little.

When the music ended, I had no conclusions.
I only noticed that the heaviness in today was gone.
