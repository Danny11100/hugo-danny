## About the Internet and Blogging

I don’t think I’ve ever documented a year through public writing. Over the past two years, I talked about the “cliche” stories of yesterday, today, and tomorrow via podcast—usually by extracting a few keywords and expanding on them with experiences and reflections. It felt a bit like an essay prompt, but it made year‑end review easier to finish. Still, podcasts are ultimately for entertainment, because the show is made for others.

I’ve always taken notes, but I mostly enjoy the act of recording and rarely整理 them later, unless it’s important information like account passwords. Maybe the act of writing helps memory. Or, as the old saying goes: a dull pen beats a sharp memory.

To be honest, it’s a little strange. I think I still need to adapt to blogging as an “old‑school” medium. When I first recorded a podcast, I had to speak to myself with emotion, and that feeling was subtle. The underlying motivation is simple: I want to share sincerely, and I believe that the sharing will eventually be seen and receive positive feedback. That, to me, is a real change the internet brought to the world. Even though the signal‑to‑noise ratio keeps dropping, the internet still gives ordinary people a chance to be heard. In a sense, as a tool to reduce information gaps, as long as I can use the internet, I can move forward a bit.

## My 2024

Back to the year‑end review. In 2024, I traveled to many places—probably more, by countries and cities, than in the first thirty years of my life combined. As the saying goes, “Life is not a track, but a wilderness.” I feel that more deeply now, and I’ll write about it later.

From the second half of 2023 to the first half of 2024, I was in Europe, and then I returned to China. In that short year, as a foreigner, it felt like playing a life‑simulation game. From renting to studying to job interviews, I went through countless challenges. I plan to write separate posts about what I saw and learned. Here I’ll focus on study and work.

### Studying in Europe

After ten years, going back to the classroom felt very different—mostly because of my mindset after being polished by the real world. Internet work is all about efficiency and short‑term output, while school is more about systematic training. What kind of person you become isn’t really the school’s responsibility. At my university, international students were a minority, and most students were white locals. For locals, as long as they want to study, tuition is almost free—getting admitted is as easy as clicking “join.” I had heard that UK/US master’s programs are “cash cows,” but when I paid the fees myself, I still smiled bitterly. As someone with life experience, I can accept it: if I’m paying in a capitalist country, I’m buying experience and service. If I’m not satisfied, I can leave instead of forcing myself to adapt. Time is more precious to me.

Some impressions:

- Cliques among students are strong. It’s not exclusionary; many people have been classmates since high school or undergrad, and those relationships continue into grad school and even work. It’s a stable network society.
- Teaching quality varies a lot. Some professors just read slides, and nobody likes their class. Yet you’ll see them dressed sharply after class, riding their bikes, and it’s hard to tell they’re unmotivated at work. It almost makes you think they might be better than they appear in class.
- Learning has no age limit. I was older than many 2000s‑born classmates, but there was a local classmate in his sixties—a high‑school teacher—who believed CS and AI were the future and came back to study. I genuinely respect that (and he doesn’t need to pay tuition).
- Course content and knowledge systems feel somewhat dated. Influenced by China’s fast internet growth, I sensed Europe’s internet strengths are limited. Infrastructure and awareness are often behind; even a Xiaomi smart‑home setup can impress people here. China and the US are truly two flowers blooming together in tech.
- As a foreigner, going to a diverse place matters. Accept that you are different, but also remember we are all ordinary people; skin color and cultural background are the only differences. Seek common ground while respecting differences. From a career perspective, an internationalized environment offers more opportunities; only such environments create real chances for foreigners.

### Working in Europe

Unlike the fast‑paced job search in China, I followed the European process step by step. From resume, to role selection, to application, to interviews—each step, easy in China, became a tougher challenge in Europe. The job market is stable with more permanent contracts and high layoff costs, so companies hire cautiously, especially for non‑EU candidates. Referrals matter a lot, and this differs from China. In China, internal referrals are often just fast resume forwarding with quick feedback and easy iteration. In Europe, hiring cycles are longer and more strict. They care about “fit,” and when visas add cost, foreign candidates are disadvantaged. I’ll write a separate post about my job search later.

### Traveling in Europe

One big perk of studying in Europe is the Schengen visa. The EU creates a near borderless travel experience; with a residence card, you can cross countries with almost no checks. Low‑cost flights let you hop between language regions as easily as traveling between provinces in China. Christianity once unified European culture, yet strong local identities remain—language and customs vary widely. I didn’t visit many places: mostly Southern Europe (Spain, Italy), Central Europe (Hungary, Czech Republic, Austria), and parts of Western Europe like Benelux. I still haven’t been to Northern Europe or Switzerland—maybe after saving more.

### Job Search After Returning to China

After returning, I continued job hunting. The experience in Europe made me more professional; my performance in China felt more mature than before. I learned to analyze fit around each role and to “speak nicely,” hiding some real thoughts. In Europe, as a foreigner, I had to show high fit and strong intent to keep moving forward. Back home, even with education and big‑company experience, competition was fierce, so I leaned into a more professional performance and a more positive, optimistic attitude.

### Entering Web3

After a long and serious job search, I ended up with a few offers and chose my current Web3 company. Beyond the advantages of remote work, I saw it as a bridge into Web3. I met many excellent people and gained information similar to—but also different from—the traditional internet world.

I’m still a beginner in Web3. I hope to use my Web2 experience to anchor myself here and better understand how the industry and the world work. I also want to keep learning new things, because only new knowledge brings growth, hope, and possibility.

2024 was an exceptionally hard year. The future is uncertain, but I’ll keep moving forward—without looking back.
