Sorry—it’s not me. I did a basic checkup in September. The “working‑ox indicators” were fine, but my mental state felt shaky.

I don’t sell anxiety. I am the anxiety.

On the second day of 2026, I took my parents to review their checkup results in detail—another big filial‑piety play.

Their last checkup was in 2022, right before I quit to go abroad. The old saying goes: when your parents are alive, don’t travel far; if you do, have a plan. That checkup was my way of taking stock before leaving, easing the guilt and anxiety of going far away.

Even when I was grinding in Beijing, I tried to go home every 2–3 months. But my parents rarely told me much. They assumed I was busy out there (I wasn’t always), and didn’t want to interrupt. The results were okay, so I left.

This year, remote work freed me from location constraints, and I have more time to stay at home.

I still go out each month to “see real people” so I feel connected to the world, but it’s hard to find a place that forms a minimal closed loop: either I sleep poorly or can’t find a gym.

At home, I can build a tight 2‑kilometer loop of gym + library + coffee shop. It’s efficient and regular. Credit to Ningbo’s planning and infrastructure. The only drawback is the food.

Some things in the second half of last year changed how I see myself.

Maybe I should shift my attention from chasing my own desires to focusing on the people and things around me. For now, my takeaway is: introspection is not as good as action.

Learn by doing, because staring at my breath all day would drive me crazy.

Like the story of “The Moon and Sixpence,” when we pick up the sixpence on the ground, we shouldn’t forget to look up at the moon.

I noticed my mother’s white hair blowing like snow. My father’s cigarette‑butt bonsai felt like a quiet confession of anxiety.

Living together daily, yet still focused on my own stuff—I felt guilty. So I arranged another checkup.

We already got the full report last week and planned to go on the 1st. But my dad said visiting the hospital on New Year’s Day is unlucky.

My mom had already asked Doubao about the report and whether her medications were appropriate. I also set up an Ant A‑Fu profile for them; it analyzed the report and gave suggestions.

AI is rapidly changing life. If I could choose one area to be transformed, it would be healthcare.

Hospitals are packed during holidays. Many people travel far to top‑tier hospitals. Most are workers who only have time to service their “parts” on holidays.

Lab tests often take time, so you have to make multiple trips.

Compared with the cumbersome traditional process, AI doctors win trust with friendly, simple conversations. My mom praised Doubao’s patience and detail more than once.

Of course, I reminded her it’s just a reference.

Doubao also tries to please you. If you’re cautious, it suggests cautious medication and extra tests, which can create unnecessary worry.

We booked a general clinic, like a family doctor. The doctor reviewed each indicator and mainly made suggestions and referrals.

Overall, the doctor’s judgment was close to Doubao’s.

Maybe it’s the GP role or the doctor’s style, but this doctor framed things more seriously, perhaps to get patients to pay attention.

Compared with doctors who say “it’s nothing, just recheck,” this isn’t that friendly for older people, who naturally don’t like being told they’re unhealthy.

I didn’t mind. Signals matter—they’re the start of a process. But it’s hard to tell which words are truly “right,” nice or harsh.

So… ask Doubao more.

Both of them have some hypertension. My dad also has abnormal lipid and kidney indicators, so he was referred to cardiology and nephrology.

We met one “empty‑headed” doctor and one “grumpy” doctor.

The first prescribed basic meds and said to observe; he didn’t like to communicate much.

The “grumpy” doctor reviewed past records and meds and inferred the kidney issue might be tied to an older blood‑pressure drug.

She suggested a controlled‑variable approach: stop the current med that may burden the kidneys, switch to a gentler plan, and recheck in a month.

If it’s still significant, hospitalization and a biopsy might be needed.

We got nervous at “hospitalization.” I felt suddenly humble in my blind spot and hoped for more guidance.

It made me think about relationships. We can’t wait for problems and then hope for miracles. Having doctor friends may not change much, but it helps you feel safe.

Faced with a rainbow of indicators, I didn’t even tell my dad to quit smoking and drinking. I used to preach and shout slogans—now I don’t think it works. Better to say: drink less, keep it moderate, and use indicators as monitoring.

When he sees those arrows, he isn’t happy. Forcing abstinence can backfire.

In the end, huge respect for medical insurance and all healthcare workers.

With insurance, my parents aren’t afraid to go to hospitals. What I can do is accompany them emotionally, review regularly, and keep pushing.

It’s also because of insurance that people run to hospitals for small issues. The volume is huge, and doctors and nurses are exhausted.

I can’t imagine working in that environment every day. There are few smiles—mostly worry, fatigue, and anxiety.

Even waiting in chairs for our number felt draining.

And honestly, thank you, AI—especially Doubao.

I sometimes joke that when I work, short videos keep my parents in a flow state.

Doubao’s arrival made my mom fall in love with asking questions. She’s no longer afraid to ask “silly” things because it’s always patient.

She’s also willing to read more, because the structured explanations are easy to follow.

I saw a curiosity in my mom that might be even stronger than mine.

Your fifties are a great age for curiosity.

I hope AI continues to level access to knowledge—bringing ordinary people closer to knowledge and farther from套路.

On the way home, we watched roads being rebuilt and widened, and chatted about housing and stability. I’ve learned to block those conversations with health indicators.

Because for ordinary people, a qualified checkup report may be the only certainty in an uncertain era.
