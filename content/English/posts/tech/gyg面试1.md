Today I’m reviewing my experience finding a product manager job in Europe. Europe’s strengths lie in fundamental sciences and traditional industries, which created a certain dependence on industry. The current internet landscape in Europe feels more like China ten years ago—going through “Internet+” digitalization and mobile transformation. But because of fragmented markets and regulatory constraints, it’s hard for monopoly‑style giants to emerge. This matches my impression of European companies: small, beautiful, focused.

As a result, European internet firms focus more on B2B products like SaaS that serve many local SMEs. Consumer internet (social, e‑commerce) is still early, which ironically leaves room for global giants to expand.

Europe never lacks technical talent—Python, Linux, and the World Wide Web all originated here. The irony is that Europeans still rely heavily on American products for information and social usage (Instagram, Google), while China’s TikTok has everyone scrolling short videos.

In terms of internet prospects, most energy is concentrated in the US and China. The US leads with technical transformation and business model innovation, focusing on product design and business models. China often benchmarks the US but adapts to local conditions; its advantages are operational ability and offline channels, plus a “Great Wall” moat. Still, China is developing its own strengths. One sentence: China is a high‑speed experimental field. It’s the world’s largest unified market (language, currency, consumption habits), with a huge basic‑education dividend. That’s why foreign companies once rushed into China. Capital goes where returns are, and that won’t change soon.

I don’t speak local languages, and I don’t fully understand these markets or user habits. I can only apply basic frameworks, which clearly doesn’t leave a deep impression. Still, I decided to try. Before this, my work and study were focused on China. As a user‑facing PM, you must understand users and markets to identify pain points, solve them with standardized products, and scale through iteration and distribution. Internet products’ biggest advantage is low marginal cost; scale increases returns. Those strengths are hard to apply in Europe.

### Choosing Target Companies

After initial analysis, I focused on internationalized internet companies. Their culture is more diverse and closer to my experience, and they need international talent—though that also means competing with strong candidates from around the world.

I’ll use Berlin‑based GetYourGuide (GYG) as a case study. The whole process took about two months, and I was rejected in the co‑founder interview.

### Company Selection & Background Research

Visa is critical. Many companies filter out most international candidates based on resume and visa status. SMEs especially dislike the extra cost—both the time and salary cost—of sponsoring visas. So choose companies willing to sponsor; they usually state this in job postings.

“Destination travel” was new to me; in simple terms, it’s like local guides or ticket middlemen. GYG acts as a broker; one founder is Chinese, which may imply Chinese capital and internet DNA. That gave me a small résumé fit advantage.

Although I had no travel‑industry experience, the essence of internet products is traffic. Mainstream business models—ads, e‑commerce, gaming—work anywhere. GYG looks like a commission‑based e‑commerce model but depends heavily on offline resources and is a niche track. Unlike OTAs (Booking, TripAdvisor) with higher margins, GYG’s profit space is limited, and it’s not like food delivery platforms with low margin and huge scale.

GYG was founded in 2009, earlier than many Chinese internet companies. ByteDance, for example, was founded in 2012 and is now a global entertainment “product factory” and “time black hole.” GYG is moving toward mobile app transformation and is relatively advanced compared to peers still focused on web. This also relates to its acquisition strategy that relies heavily on Google search.

After comparison, I believed the company and role fit my background. Similar targets included Booking and Airbnb, so it was worth trying.

### Resume Preparation & Optimization

Before applying, I prepared several general English resumes. By packaging past experience and aligning with the role, I tried to help European recruiters quickly see my background, capability, and fit. I realized the power of big‑platform brands. Labels like “ByteDance,” “TikTok,” and “Baidu,” even if not as famous as FAANG, draw far more attention than unknown companies.

The core of a resume is **fit**. If your experience is close to the role’s business model, you can ramp faster. So it matters to express your strengths clearly using STAR, and to be confident without exaggeration. At this stage, I wasn’t just representing myself—ByteDance’s label was also backing me.

Another surprise: European companies value cover letters far more than I expected. Some roles even require one. This formalism is exhausting for mass‑applications. Without ChatGPT, most energy would go into cover letters.

### Initial Screening (HR)

I applied via LinkedIn and company sites. But Europe strongly values referrals and networks. Some roles are filled from internal pools; only when internal channels fail do they go public. Good opportunities are scarce—filled internally or by referral; only then do they “race” in the open market.

I applied for a growth‑traffic role. Although it required Google SEO expertise, I aligned my Baidu experience because the logic is similar. I hadn’t worked directly with Google SEO/SEM, but I couldn’t expect them to use Baidu either.

Luckily I passed the resume screen and got an HR call. In China, HR often has limited power and mostly collects info and schedules interviews (except in companies like Alibaba where HR plays a stronger role). In Europe, the HR screen felt as rigorous as a final HR round at Alibaba.

They usually start with small talk to assess language and communication, then ask basic questions to evaluate background, cultural values, and visa needs. They care about motivation and value alignment. By stereotype, white female HRs often rejected me—why, I don’t know. My instinct is that, as an international candidate, without strong reasons, European firms prefer local PMs.

This time, the interviewer was a white male HR. I was well prepared, expressed fit, and proposed solutions based on their needs. Maybe after many failures I was more fluent; maybe the screen was looser. Either way, I moved forward and started the painful interview journey.
