Recently I built a “life account” plan around health, relationships, cash flow, learning, and exploration. The benefit is that it gives me a framework to organize life.

Each account can be invested in via micro‑habits—value averaging and hedging in behavior, or a way to counter life’s uncertainty. By monitoring progress and feelings and allocating attention like a portfolio, it’s more effective than a random to‑do list.

If I get more insights, I’ll share later. Today’s notes come from a sub‑task in my “cognition account.”

### 1) Distribution for Homogeneous AI Apps

A friend’s blunt question stuck with me: *why are you still thinking in platform logic?*

In the AI era, a more realistic approach for individuals is to amplify existing strengths and serve a specific group well. Maybe we should gradually abandon the mass‑platform mindset. If you keep circling the old logic, you probably haven’t truly found your target users or needs.

### 2) Don’t All‑in High Risk, and Don’t Lock Yourself by Fear

This line feels important lately. By the way, AI is really good at comforting people.

GPT gives me “correct but empty” planning advice, yet it does ease emotions sometimes.

### 3) Comparison Creates Judgment

Without comparison, everything feels fuzzy and intuition isn’t enough.

I’m slowly realizing that in past choices, what I lacked wasn’t effort, but judgment. Choice often matters more than effort, and learning to choose well may be a life‑long task. Strong people have more options; for me, at least I need to compare so I can distinguish the better from the second‑best.

### A Podcast I Listened To

![](/wechat/wx-20260106-fd542b/img-02.jpg)

Guest: Liu Ye, CEO of Zuoyebang, a serial entrepreneur.

A headhunter recently introduced his new project **Talkit**—an AI × 3D virtual world for speaking practice. Wealth + idealism often lead people to life sciences or education.

I saw comments calling him “pretentious,” but after listening, I felt his expression was quite sincere.

Some notes that stayed with me:

1. *Entrepreneurship mindset: “the sea of suffering isn’t suffering.” When you see a blue ocean clearly, the current hardship hurts less.*
2. *Advice to AI founders: beware of “fake opportunity” anxiety. Real opportunities are few and require time to find.*
3. *Embrace solitude. Don’t fear that only you can see what you’re doing; solitude often means scarcity.*
4. *“Only by making mistakes can you spend time with yourself and learn what’s right.”*
5. *The best way to dissolve regret is to do something better than before.*

I also tried the product. It’s been polished for two years and is only about 30 points out of 100, but already ready for users—fair assessment.

Duolingo feels like a game that wraps language learning. Speaking practice needs to overcome fear and actually speak.

Lately I practice speaking with Doubao to keep a language feel. With context memory, it’s closer to a real tutor now; it even asks whether I finished yesterday’s tasks.

Sometimes I ask it to throw questions at me instead of small talk. Questions trigger thinking and expression more easily.

Expression isn’t about how native the accent is; it’s about communicating clearly. A bit of personal emotion is enough—most people aren’t giving academic talks anyway.
