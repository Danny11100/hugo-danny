Today I saw a news item about an app with a jarring name climbing to the top of the download charts. It’s called “Dead Yet?” The first time most people see the name, they frown—it feels awkward.

But when I thought about it, it actually felt… normal.

This app isn’t really about “arranging your death.” It’s simple: set an emergency contact, then check in daily with one tap. If you stop checking in for several days, the system notifies your emergency contact. It’s basically a **daily safety‑status reminder**, especially for people who live alone or travel often.

I once thought seriously about a similar idea—not from fear of death, but from a very ordinary trigger.

While organizing my asset allocation, I suddenly realized how many accounts and platforms only I understand. If the path is broken, no one can access them. If something happens, my parents might know these assets exist but **have no idea where to start**.

That thought felt unsettling.

Later I整理 the key information, contacts, and account paths. Some might call it “writing a will,” but for me it’s more like a memo to myself. Not to leave inheritance, nor to rehearse the worst case—just to ensure that what only I understand doesn’t become a black box for others.

Then I asked myself:

> If I were really gone, would that money matter to my parents?

Probably not.

They may not even want to touch it. What I really worry about is not “whether the money will be used,” but that in an already painful moment, they’d have to face a pile of unfamiliar things with no explanation.

Seen this way, “Dead Yet?” is over‑interpreted. It isn’t a pessimistic tool or a “death game.” It’s a **mechanism that makes daily safety visible**.

People download it not because they’re obsessed with death, but because in a hyper‑digital world, information is scattered and the people who need to back you up often know the least. In that structure,整理 key things is a very normal reaction.

One line still matters:

**Health and safety are always number one.**

These discussions and preparations should not amplify risk. Being safe, alive, and never needing these tools is the best state. If we prepare at all, it’s only to make the worst case a little less bad.
