At first I thought futures trading was just a toy for a small group of high‑risk crypto players, while spot was the “mainstream.” After getting involved, I realized I was wrong. In crypto, spot volume is far smaller than futures—futures are the real main force (though most people still trade spot). This “fast lane” lets you feel market turbulence every second. You don’t need to own the asset; you just predict price movements and speculate on the spread. I learned the hard way that in this market, the strongest capital often decides the direction.

## Instant Feedback and Emotional Swings

One of futures trading’s biggest attractions is speed of feedback. Every minute, even every second, price movements affect your PnL. It’s like the instant feedback of short videos—an upgraded form of “numbing pleasure,” except the feedback is money up or down.

That speed is addictive. When you lose, you think, “If I try again, maybe the market will give me a chance.” When you win, excitement makes you reckless: “One more bet.” Often that extra bet causes the final loss. Watching the K‑line feels like a roller coaster—euphoria on the way up, panic on the way down. You want to stop and calm down, but desire pulls you deeper.

## Rational vs. Irrational Judgment

I used to obsess over charts and support/resistance. Then I learned: in futures markets, technical analysis can be window dressing. The real drivers are “operators” and big money. Each time I bought or sold with confidence, the market refused to follow my script. Sometimes violent moves were simply games of capital—intentions that no chart could predict.

Futures prices don’t rely solely on fundamentals or technicals. They’re driven more by capital flows and manipulation. In a large game, you and I are just pieces. We think we’re making decisions, but big money has already laid the board. Every rally or crash can be a carefully designed trap, and we’re just participants—lured in or forced out.

## Retail Limits and Mental Training

As retail, I know my limits. Leverage doesn’t just amplify gains, it amplifies risk. You think you’ve caught the rhythm, but a single swing can trap you. No matter how accurate your analysis feels, it can’t resist the force of big money. The harder you try to predict, the more you’re fooled by false signals. Every wrong judgment becomes a costly lesson.

Worse, emotions drive decisions. I know the market may keep falling, but a small bounce makes me buy. When it rises, I fear missing out and keep adding. After losses, regret and anxiety torture me: “If I had shorted, I could have avoided this.” That regret creates a loop. Every unwilling attempt drains confidence.

## Speculation as a Battle With Yourself

The essence of futures trading isn’t a battle with the market—it’s a battle with greed and fear. Every buy or sell tests your judgment, patience, and risk tolerance. You watch the market and wrestle your own emotions. A good strategy helps, but what decides the outcome is always your mental state.

Here, reason and emotion alternate constantly. Reason tells you to short, but as the market rises, emotion doubts you and wants to go long. Fear tells you to cut losses, but greed makes you hold. This inner battle never stops, and capital gets burned in the process.

At this point, anyone who isn’t the house yet still plays with big leverage is truly fierce.

And I’m just a leek.
