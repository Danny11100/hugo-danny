I’m Danny, from China, and after studying in Europe, I’m now back in Asia, exploring the Web3 ecosystem and looking to apply my Web2 experience to build decentralized Web3 products. I’m particularly interested in UGC and social products, especially in the context of Web3.

### I am a Product Manager
I’ve worked as a Product Manager at TikTok (China), Baidu, and other dynamic startups, with extensive experience taking products from zero to one. I specialize in validating market needs with MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and scaling products to reach millions. I focus on understanding user needs and market fit, and am passionate about continuously iterating products based on data and user feedback.

### I am a Podcaster
I’ve created and promoted a Chinese podcast focused on topics like self-improvement, technology, and innovation, which has gained nearly 5 million plays. Currently, I’m planning a new podcast focused on Web3 and personal growth.

### My Interests
- Exploring the potential and challenges of Web3  
- Building innovative decentralized products  
- Fitness and cooking  
- Movies, music, and books  

### Why I Blog
This blog is a space for me to share insights and learnings, a way to connect beyond conventional socializing. It’s also a practice ground for my English writing.

### Want to Talk?
I’m open to chatting with people from all over the world. If you have questions or just want to share your thoughts, email me at [contact@yfreetime.com](mailto:contact@yfreetime.com).
