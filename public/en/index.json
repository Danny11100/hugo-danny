[{"content":"Today, I’m drawn to recount an experience steeped in tranquility and introspection: my ten-day Vipassana retreat in a quaint temple nestled within China’s serene landscape back in 2017. At that juncture, freshly embarking on my career, I was grappling with life’s profound questions. These ruminations have resurfaced, echoing the present day as I confront a spate of lukewarm responses to my job applications across Europe and the fatigue of cultural assimilation. Amidst this, I recognize an acute need for stillness, self-reflection, and a constructive approach to life’s hurdles. Vipassana has, once again, become my sanctuary.\nNavigating the Job Market’s Choppy Waters In my quest for growth, I’ve found myself ensnared in a conundrum, having cast a wide net for product manager roles throughout Europe—primarily in Germany and the Netherlands. Regrettably, invitations to interview are rare, and on the occasion they do arise, the specter of visa issues often leads to doors closing. It’s a rational preference, from a corporate standpoint, to opt for local talent, particularly in roles demanding an intimate comprehension of user behaviors and preferences in order to sculpt features that resonate deeply.\nNevertheless, these setbacks have not quelled my spirit. Each interview serves as a crucible for personal and professional refinement. My perseverance harks back to the days of Vipassana.\nThe Art of Stillness Amidst the Noise The essence of Vipassana transcends borders, with myriad interpretations around the globe. At its core, “super-seeing” defines it, yet most embrace it as a pathway to “insight” or “clear-seeing”—a journey inward rather than an examination of our external reality. Its parallels with meditation are uncanny; both are bastions of focus and serenity. I’ve come to regard it as ‘the art of stillness.’ Embracing Vipassana means forgoing the digital chatter of modernity for contemplation; a world where silence reigns, and the rhythm of one’s breath becomes the sole focus, devoid of even the most transient of eye contacts. This is the practice of severing ties with the tumult of the external world to delve into the self.\nA Glimpse of Vipassana: The Beginning of a Journey Fast forward a year, and I found myself in a startup’s dynamic crucible, though the winds of change were tapering off, with competition outpacing us. Once ordered, our management descended into disarray. As a junior product manager, I was privy to the CEO’s vision—initiatives that seemed potent at inception. Yet, I pondered if our trajectory truly aligned with our user’s desires or merely mirrored executive conjecture. Caught between acquiescence and skepticism, I sought clarity through Vipassana, compelling me to apply for leave. In an unexpected gesture, my CEO bestowed upon me a Buddhist sutra—a harbinger of the introspective journey ahead.\nAdmitting to a flicker of skepticism—courtesy of their antiquated online presence—I decided to lean into the unfamiliar, spurred by a youthful zest for transformative experiences that promised an escape from the ennui of routine.\n(To be continued…)\n","permalink":"https://yfreetime.com/en/posts/life/embracing-serenity-in-the-storm_1/","summary":"Join me as I recount my transformative ten-day Vipassana experience and draw parallels to the current challenges I face with job applications in Europe.

I applied for some time off, flew to a different city, and ventured to an obscure mountain with my luggage in tow. Opting to hike to the summit instead of taking a bus, I felt my journey had truly begun with that choice. Upon arrival, I noticed I was among the youngest attendees; surrounded mostly by individuals who could be uncles and aunts. Their surprise was palpable — perhaps, from their vantage point, a young man like me shouldn’t be burdened by significant troubles. Yet, it was curiosity more than anxiety that propelled me forward. I saw this as a cool adventure and a potential release from work stress.\nThe Art of Letting Go Upon arrival, we were required to surrender all our belongings to the organization, including cash and mobile phones. I joked to myself that if I were to be kidnapped, no one would know. Thankfully, this was an official and trustworthy organization. With the retreat starting the next day, our first evening involved watching a documentary on Vipassana before retiring early at 9 p.m.\nA Day of New Beginnings The regimen for the next ten days was stringent, spanning from 4 a.m. to 9 p.m., a schedule unheard of in bustling city life. Unsurprisingly, my first night was restless, attributed to this sudden lifestyle shift and the anticipation of the days ahead.\nOn Day 1, I rose at 4:00 a.m. and embarked on my first prolonged session of cross-legged meditation. The unfamiliarity made it challenging to maintain focus on my breathing. Persevering through two hours led to a welcome breakfast break, featuring an array of delicious vegetarian dishes. The day continued in this pattern: meditate, eat, meditate, with each session proving more monotonous than I’d anticipated. Had I known the extent of the repetition, my initial enthusiasm might have waned. Yet, my resolve to complete what I had started kept me anchored.\nLessons in Mindfulness and Impermanence Despite the time that has elapsed since the retreat, the memory of leg pain and discomfort lingers vividly. That first day was a relentless cycle of redirecting my wandering mind back to my breath, interspersed with intrusive thoughts about work and life. The instructor’s advice was clear: leave external concerns outside and focus solely on breathing.\nThe essence of Vipassana became clearer when physical discomfort from prolonged sitting arose. Rather than succumbing to irritation, I learned to observe the pain without reaction, understanding that it, too, would pass. Similarly, fleeting moments of comfort or focus weren’t to be celebrated but observed with the same detachment, embodying the principle that all experiences, pleasant or unpleasant, are transient.\n(To be continued…)\n","permalink":"https://yfreetime.com/en/posts/life/embracing-serenity-in-the-storm_2/","summary":"Join me as I recount my transformative ten-day Vipassana experience and draw parallels to the current challenges I face with job applications in Europe.

Yet, as we wade through the ephemeral streams of TikToks, Tweets, and status updates, the allure of a dedicated digital space — a personal website — becomes increasingly compelling. This blog post embarks on a journey to unravel the ‘Why,’ ‘How,’ and ‘What’ of building a personal website amidst the clamor of social media, with a special lens on the Chinese digital landscape and a global perspective.\nWhy a Personal Website? The digital landscape in China offers a unique vantage point. With the ubiquity of platforms like WeChat and TikTok, the idea of a personal website might seem superfluous. Yet, there’s a growing awareness of the limitations and impermanence of relying solely on social media for one’s digital identity. Personal websites emerge as bastions of individuality and permanence in the fluid world of social media, offering a canvas for deeper, more nuanced self-expression.\nGlobally, the narrative isn’t vastly different. While platforms like Facebook and Instagram offer broad reach and engagement, they operate within the confines of their respective ecosystems. A personal website, on the other hand, is a sanctuary of self-sovereignty in the digital realm — a place where one can articulate their narrative unencumbered by algorithmic whims or platform policies.\nHow to Craft Your Digital Abode The process of creating a personal website is akin to constructing a home. It begins with a foundation — choosing a domain name that resonates with your digital identity. For instance, while I selected Aliyun for its affordability, I navigated away from their hosting services to sidestep potential bureaucratic entanglements, opting for Bluehost to ensure global reach.\nThe soul of a website lies in its content — the authentic expression of thoughts, ideas, and creativity. Whether it’s succinct musings or in-depth articles, the content reflects the essence of the creator. Leveraging platforms like WordPress, I engineered a site that’s not only user-friendly but also SEO-optimized, ensuring that my digital voice can be heard amidst the cacophony of the internet.\nSecurity and speed are paramount, hence my choice of Cloudflare to bolster my site’s defenses and performance. This journey from a mere concept to a live digital entity highlights the pivotal role of strategic planning and prioritization of content over aesthetic embellishments.\nReflections and Revelations Embarking on this digital construction project has been an enlightening expedition. The evolution of my website from a Hexo and GitHub Pages experiment to a robust WordPress and Bluehost-powered entity underscores the dynamic nature of digital creations. It’s a testament to the idea that a website, much like its creator, is an ever-evolving entity.\nAdopting a theme like GeneratePress and tools like Elementor allowed me to mold my site’s aesthetics without sacrificing functionality. This iterative approach to web design and content curation has been instrumental in crafting a digital identity that’s not only reflective of my persona but also resonant with a global audience.\nThe Global Digital Mosaic While the narrative of my website’s creation is deeply personal, it’s part of a broader global conversation about digital independence and identity. In a world where social media’s ephemeral nature often dilutes individuality, a personal website stands as a testament to one’s unique digital footprint.\nThrough this blog, I extend an invitation to you, the reader, to embark on your journey of digital self-discovery. Whether you’re in China, navigating the vast WeChat ecosystem, or anywhere else in the world, the endeavor of creating a personal website offers a rewarding avenue to assert your digital autonomy, craft your narrative, and leave a lasting imprint on the internet’s vast tapestry.\nIn conclusion, while the allure of social media’s immediate reach is undeniable, the enduring value of a personal website cannot be overstated. It’s a digital homestead that offers not just a platform for expression but also a legacy that transcends the fleeting nature of social media trends. So, as we advance further into the digital age, let’s embrace the art of website creation, not just as a technical endeavor, but as a profound exercise in digital self-expression and identity crafting.\n","permalink":"https://yfreetime.com/en/posts/tech/building-a-personal-website-in-a-social-media-driven-world/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn an era dominated by the instantaneous gratification of social media, the notion of creating a personal website might seem, at first glance, like a quaint relic from a bygone digital epoch.
