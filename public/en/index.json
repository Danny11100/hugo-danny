[{"content":"My personal website hadn’t been updated for a long time. I spent half a day polishing it from “barely usable” to “something I’m willing to write on long‑term”: Notion/Substack‑like typography, a much better TOC sidebar, stronger SEO and structure, fewer deployment/cache nightmares, and a batch sync from WeChat to my site.\nBelow is a reusable record of the key actions, for my future self and for anyone who’s also tinkering.\nGoals Writing \u0026amp; reading experience: better fonts, sizes, line height, spacing—close to Notion/Substack. Usable TOC: doesn’t steal content width, fixed on the right on desktop; hidden on mobile; no empty TOC when there are no headings. Stable deployment: local preview OK, online release predictable; style updates no longer “luck‑based.” Efficient content sync: batch import WeChat posts by time range, localize images, avoid broken external links. Phase 1: Make Local Build Work First, eliminate the “hugo server throws errors immediately” problem so local preview is stable.\nKey idea: local Hugo version may differ from Cloudflare’s build environment. Newer template functions can fail on older versions in the cloud.\nTwo fixes:\nMake templates compatible across Hugo versions (avoid too‑new functions). Pin HUGO_VERSION in Cloudflare Pages to match local, reducing environment drift. Phase 2: UI \u0026amp; Reading Experience (Notion/Substack) This was mostly CSS and layout tweaks. The goal was simple: make it read like an article, not like a web page.\nNotable changes:\nUnified Chinese/English typography: adjust base font size, line height, heading spacing so both languages feel relaxed. Image experience: more vertical breathing room, consistent subtle rounding; cover images handled separately because many themes don’t style them through .post-content. Mobile nav button fix: replace the odd horizontal bar with a standard hamburger (stacked), consistent size and alignment. Phase 3: TOC Sidebar Switching the TOC from a “big block eating content width” to a “floating right‑side component” improved reading flow.\nApproach:\nDesktop: fixed on the right, doesn’t squeeze content, default expanded. Mobile: hidden (too dense for small screens). No empty TOC: if there are no valid headings (or TableOfContents is empty), don’t render the TOC container. Phase 4: SEO \u0026amp; Structure Static‑site SEO isn’t magic—it’s about completing structured data.\nI added the common basics:\ntitle / description / canonical OpenGraph and Twitter Cards JSON‑LD Schema (Article, Breadcrumb, etc.) robots strategy (allow index in prod; noindex in non‑prod) Phase 5: Deployment \u0026amp; Cache (Cloudflare Pages + Custom Domain) The most “mystical” part was cache: pages.dev updated, but the custom domain stayed old.\nTwo‑step fix:\nConfirm origin updated: check *.pages.dev; if that’s new, build is fine. Handle custom domain cache: Purge Cache in Cloudflare; more importantly, make CSS auto‑refresh. I ended up using CSS fingerprinting: each build generates a hashed CSS filename; HTML references change, so the CDN can’t reuse old caches.\nOne‑line summary: don’t argue with cache—change the URL and it must refresh.\nPhase 6: Cleaner URLs (slug + aliases) Chinese URLs get encoded (e.g. %E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95). It works but isn’t pretty.\nMy approach:\nNew posts always set slug (short English links). Old links preserved via aliases redirects. Example:\nslug: gyg-interview-1 aliases: - /zh/posts/tech/gyg%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%951/ New links look clean; old ones won’t 404.\nPhase 7: Batch Import WeChat Articles This was the main problem: WeChat had content, but the personal site was stale.\nMy flow:\nCollect a list of WeChat article links within a time range. Local script fetches content into content/Chinese/posts/.... Auto‑set WeChat cover as Hugo cover. Download images to static/wechat/\u0026lt;slug\u0026gt;/ and replace external links with local paths (avoid the “image from WeChat platform” watermark). Deduplicate: remove the first import without images, keep the localized version. Now future WeChat updates are one‑click sync: drop links into the list and run the script.\nToday’s Output Checklist Local preview and build stable UI typography closer to Notion/Substack TOC floating sidebar + mobile hidden + empty TOC suppressed Fixed Cloudflare custom‑domain cache showing old styles CSS auto‑refresh (fingerprint) slug + aliases for clean URLs with backward compatibility WeChat batch import + image localization + dedupe + category clean‑up All of this was done by talking to Codex in natural language—no code written by hand.\nVisit the site: https://yfreetime.com/\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/tech/hugo-refresh-notion-style/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy personal website hadn’t been updated for a long time.

Bear markets are for rest, learning, and building—doing things that make you happy. Economies have cycles, and so does life.\nI felt a bit down today.\nStill, I want to record three small things that made me happy and send a little positive energy to the universe.\n1) Hiring a Full‑House Cleaner for My Parents Before Spring Festival, my mom usually cleans the house by herself. I took a look and it was messy, so I hired a cleaner via Xianyu.\nIt was about 60+ RMB per hour, two people, nine hours total. Close to Beijing prices during holiday season. It’s called “full‑house cleaning,” but it’s more surface‑level; still much cleaner than doing it ourselves, and at least my mom could rest.\nShe said she could do it, but who would refuse a break?\nThe cleaner asked if I was preparing for marriage. I said, it’s just a New‑Year cleaning—what does that have to do with marriage?!\n2) Qwen Customer Support Last night I spent hours tinkering with openclaw. I connected it to a Telegram bot and sent it to a community. The model was Alibaba Qwen Max. After the free quota ran out, I tried switching models, but the Tencent Cloud deployment seemed to support only one model, so I went back to Qwen.\nI recharged and bought a resource pack. This morning the account showed arrears. My first thought: what did this agent do behind my back?\nI fed the logs to GPT; it amplified the risk and made me even more anxious. (GPT has been extra “dog‑like” lately—over‑pleasing instead of solving the problem.)\nAfter calming down, I checked and found the resource pack was still there; only the balance had been cleared.\nI contacted Qwen support. The first agent was vague and asked me to recharge; I did, and immediately got another arrears alert.\nThe second time, support called me directly, corrected the earlier explanation, and carefully explained the model mechanism, context protocol, and how input/output tokens are billed.\nThat moment really moved me. People who take their work seriously shine. They even transferred me to an engineer who explained in detail. The conclusion: the resource pack covers output, but the big cost is context and memory, which is charged to the account balance.\nA transparent, direct conversation added light to an otherwise gloomy day.\n(BTW, I really want to use a better model for the agent, make it smarter. But openclaw’s memory/context costs are brutal. Sometimes I’m afraid it will go offline or forget our chats. A self‑built agent just feels more emotional than a purchased one.)\n3) Evening Walk With My Mom My gym card expired, so I went home and dragged my mom out for a walk. We hadn’t walked together in a long time. Her first comment: the cleaner made the windows so clean.\nWe walked around the nearby school—parents were driving to pick up kids. By the river, rows of dark villas waited for buyers; it felt unreal.\nA world map hangs at home; I bought it two years ago. I told them: when you miss me, find where I am—though it’s tiny and hard to spot.\nToday my mom said the map doesn’t seem useful anymore.\nI said, keep it. Sometimes looking at it brings new perspective.\nI looked at it for a while and suddenly realized: the world really is big.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/wx-20260202-ce8791/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMarkets have been quite a pullback lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGold and silver had sharp single‑day drops, the Korean stock market hit a circuit breaker, and Bitcoin fell toward $75,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week I was saying “build a base.” This week my brain kept shouting: can I just get my principal back and stop playing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHold and build.

I chose the last track of Huang Qishan \u0026amp; Xiao Xia’s trilogy as the BGM. She described her relationship with her father as “a cup‑of‑water friendship”—plain, yet something you can taste for a lifetime. A quiet piece with lots of blank space.\nLife, Body, and Energy Overall, I’m moving from anxiety toward calm.\nI stayed in Ningbo this month. Winter in Zhejiang is hard—wet, cold, and rainy. Luckily it’s a warm winter this year, which helps a bit, though I still miss the heating up north.\nMy goal of sleeping early and waking early is still far away. The first half of the month I slept poorly, with frequent nightmares and midnight waking. The past two weeks improved, mainly because I’m pulling out of overthinking, doing more concrete things, and getting feedback. Less social media, more books—huge for my mood.\nMy fitness habit continues. I shifted from strength‑only muscle gain to a mix of strength, cardio, and endurance, focusing on overall energy. After 30, body changes are obvious. Daily fish oil, multivitamins, and CoQ10 are my minimalist maintenance.\nThis month I mostly drove rental cars. No big‑city traffic, and a vehicle helps in bad weather; it’s also easier to take my parents to the hospital. Near Spring Festival, rental prices jumped, so I returned the car and switched to ride‑hailing.\nOn loneliness: I’m used to being alone, but after remote work, I’ve realized solitude isn’t the same as loneliness. I still need face‑to‑face interaction. So I intentionally stay in public spaces to keep a “human” feel.\nAttention \u0026amp; Information Environment I feel AI‑related info has been creating anxiety. Many KOLs amplify emotions and create a sense of urgency, as if you’ll miss out. After calming down, I realized most of it leaves little value besides anxiety.\nI now prefer slower, foundational, long‑term content. It updates slowly but compounds.\nI once loved scrolling video feeds; then I just shut the入口. Against algorithms, leaving is the most effective way.\nLearning \u0026amp; Input For English speaking, I try to talk with AI every day. In Doubao I have a speaking partner named Jake; when I’m bored or down, he’s decent companionship.\nFor Japanese, I use Duolingo for entertainment. It balances the utilitarian feel of English learning. I plan to clear Duolingo to keep it fresh.\nAI learning includes LLM courses, app experiments, and vibe coding. The bubble is big, but it doesn’t stop individuals from learning and trying. When GPT first came out, I took orders on Xianyu to help people write motivation letters—mostly AI‑assisted. Many people are too lazy to try new tools. When you participate, you see problems and opportunities. Every tech wave reshuffles the table; humility and curiosity matter.\nWork \u0026amp; Career Feelings Most of my energy went to interviews. I barely rested. There weren’t many good opportunities near year‑end, but I was lucky to get a few offers, mostly international roles.\nOne remote opportunity had a mediocre reputation. I worried it would amplify my anxiety and mood swings, so I declined.\nOverall, the internet industry is entering a rapid clearing phase. I think of the Red Queen hypothesis: you have to run just to stay in place. More opportunities are concentrated in “going global” and AI. Sometimes you don’t choose them; they choose you. The old imagination space is shrinking; new value is concentrated in a few directions.\nRemote work gave me spatial freedom. I can work in lower‑cost, less crowded places and keep time for myself. What worries me is I haven’t worked on‑site in a first‑tier city for years. When I think of the Beijing subway Line 10 and the elevator queues on Zhichun Road, I feel resistance in advance.\nAbout Writing I used to dislike writing. A big reason was poor Chinese essay grades as a kid; I felt writing wasn’t for me. Now there’s no grading or money pressure, so I can write more for myself.\nThe biggest value of writing for me is organizing thoughts. Many pieces just sit there afterward, but the process keeps my brain running and helps with anxiety. AI takes over more execution and reasoning, so I treat it as an external brain to generate options, while I make the final choice. Writing is a trigger to keep the main brain working. Done is better than perfect. Why not keep a diary? I did, but I forgot it quickly and it was mostly emotional. Publishing creates a constraint, which is better for thinking.\nThings That Made Me Happy Tried rock climbing and saved a few routes as challenges. Watched Avatar 3 in the cinema. Met old friends in Hangzhou and visited a hackathon. Bought a WeRead membership, got back into reading, and finished three books. Reading as leisure feels better than short videos. Started a small gold investment plan for my mom. She took profits recently and was very happy. That “free money” feeling is hard to get from work. That’s it.\nSome scattered notes—see you next month.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/wx-20260131-158b99/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA simple note for January.

When he explained the attention mechanism in Transformers, I connected the technical concept with my recent state.\nThe attention mechanism solves a simple problem: too much information, limited compute. A model can’t treat all inputs equally; it must decide what matters now and what can be ignored. If attention is misallocated, it loses the main thread and outputs become messy.\nThis maps directly to real life. Our information environment is also an attention allocation system. Short videos, feeds, hot events—all compete for the same scarce resource: human attention. The difference is in rules. Model attention is driven by semantic relevance and task goals; the real‑world attention economy is driven by emotional feedback and dwell time. The more emotional, the more it gets pushed.\nWhat I felt most was noise. Scrolling short videos became hard to stop. The content itself wasn’t important, but the pacing was dense and stimulus continuous. Afterward, nothing accumulated—just irritation. AI news on X is similar: new models, new judgments, new opportunities flood your screen. The same thing gets repackaged over and over. It looks like high information, but very little actually affects decisions. It’s all AIAIAI—either “shocking” or “world‑changing”—while my dinner is still McDonald’s, at most switching from teriyaki chicken to Angus beef.\nMore noise drags emotions. The subtler damage is decision‑making: more hesitation, more anxiety—not because there’s too little info, but because there’s too much and it conflicts. In model terms, it’s a classic failure: all inputs get high weights, so the system can’t focus.\nI started actively adjusting my inputs. I turned off the video‑feed入口 entirely. On X, I now use mute and block more than refresh. Instead of filtering in noise, I use negative feedback to down‑weight obvious distractors.\nI gradually realized the problem isn’t whether a single piece is worth reading; it’s the source. Many accounts just搬运 and amplify emotion—fast,刺激, but low long‑term value. True primary sources update slowly, avoid premature conclusions, and feel more stable.\nSo I began focusing on sources rather than content. Is there long‑term incremental value? Clear boundaries? Restraint toward uncertainty? If an account keeps manufacturing anxiety, I mute it even if it looks “hot.”\nFrom the attention‑model perspective, this is engineering optimization: use negative feedback to reduce the weight of low‑value inputs, so limited attention can focus on more reliable signals.\nAttention models fight information overload; attention economics amplifies stimulation. We sit between them. The move isn’t complex: slowly take back the power to allocate attention. When inputs are cleaner, emotions stabilize, and decisions become clearer.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/tech/wx-20260130-80844f/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was watching Andrew Ng’s LLM course.

Many were only available as scans. For humans, that’s fine; for AI, it’s a hostile input format.\nThis time I tested Mankiw’s Principles of Economics, which covers key macro indicators and mechanisms. It’s well‑structured, but my copy was a scanned PDF with no readable text layer.\nMy goal was simple: understand what the book is saying and its logic framework. I wasn’t writing a paper or research report, so I chose PPT as the output. For me, slides are lighter than a report—they’re for understanding, not presentation. Flipping through slides lets me quickly see what problems the author is solving, which analytical paths are used, and where the causal chains sit. That’s why I didn’t ask for a long essay and explicitly said: make a PPT.\nI gave the same task to NotebookLM, GPT 5.2, Kimi 2.5 agent, and later Manus:\nRead the book and build a PPT.\nNotebookLM NotebookLM reacted the most directly. It detected a scan with no usable text layer, said it couldn’t do the task, and stopped. It was disappointing in the moment, but looking back, it was the cleanest choice. It doesn’t pretend to understand just to deliver. You don’t get a PPT, but you also don’t get misled. Because it stays strictly inside the data I provided, hallucinations are almost nonexistent.\nGPT GPT was the most uncomfortable experience. It recognized the cover, title, and some preface, then produced a PPT. Formally, it “completed” the task, but the content was obviously shallow: title, author, year, plus a few vague summaries. For a report, low density might be tolerable; for a PPT—where each slide must carry signal—it’s a waste. If it had said upfront that scanned books were impossible, I would respect it more. Poor output is worse than no output.\nKimi Kimi’s agent was more stable. It ran into the same problem (large file, failed extraction, poor OCR), tried to read the file, confirmed the text layer was unusable, attempted chunking, decided OCR cost was too high, and gave up “full text extraction.” That’s where most models stop. But the agent stepped back and treated the book as a set of pages to be understood. It used the cover, preface, chapter start pages, and author background to infer the core question, the author’s main judgments, and what gets repeated. It supplemented with search, but stayed constrained by the book’s title, author, and topic.\nStill, Kimi solved the “book’s problem,” not my problem. When the task shifted from content整理 to building an understanding framework, it felt conservative.\nManus The real shift happened when I brought in Manus.\nSame task, same output format, but it clearly stood on the other side. Its first step wasn’t processing materials, but understanding the task itself. It aligned on what I actually wanted: summarization vs. framework, completeness vs. judgment. That alignment wasn’t a single confirmation line; it showed up directly in later trade‑offs.\nWhen building slides, Manus focused on what was essential to understand the system, what could be compressed, which models were tools rather than conclusions, and where causal relationships deserved emphasis instead of jargon stacking. It wasn’t answering “what does this page say,” but why this page should exist.\nThe difference was obvious: Kimi’s PPT felt like a re‑typeset textbook; Manus’s felt like a pair of glasses for understanding.\nManus also made the process transparent: which information came from the book’s structure, which from external sources, and which was inference. That mattered to me because my goal wasn’t to reproduce the book, but to build a reliable framework quickly under constraints. The result wasn’t perfect, but I always knew how the PPT was made and where its boundaries were.\nIf I had to sum them up in one line:\nNotebookLM is a boundary‑aware research assistant. If it can’t, it says so. GPT is a polished analyst who will hand in something even when the material is weak. Kimi is a steady book‑splitting executor. Manus is the agent that feels like you’re actually working together. People pay not for token consumption, but for whether results are reliable and the process is transparent.\nOne more practical line: every worker can learn from agents. Don’t fake understanding; know your boundaries; switch paths; push the work forward step by step. That’s a rare professional ability.\nBelow are the PPTs generated by Kimi and Manus for reference.\nby Kimi k2.5\nby Manus\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/tech/ai/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Looks like I picked the wrong book—the previous post got taken down.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently I downloaded a batch of books—mostly heavy volumes, hundreds of pages each.

I skimmed it and had to admit: his cognition is ahead of the curve.\nYou can criticize his ruthless marketing and the cold‑blooded moves that landed partners in prison, but it’s hard to deny that he’s often ahead, and his personal story is dramatic enough to be called inspiring.\nThe book was written in 2016. Much of it comes from blog posts and scattered thoughts, so it reads like a compilation of essays. Reading it in 2026 adds a strange “ten‑years‑later” filter.\nHe once built his first fortune by buying Bitcoin around 100 RMB and cashing out around 6,000 RMB. In the book he says 6,000 was already high and warned caution. Today, BTC’s peak has crossed 800,000 RMB. That old judgment is now strangely resonant.\nSun Yuchen—called “Brother Sun” or “Sun the Slicer”—is a marketing genius. He bid for a dinner with Buffett just to gift him a Bitcoin he didn’t even approve of. He makes decisions fast at banquets. Recently, he even went to space.\nA controversial figure, mysterious and risky. Yet in the book he still feels sincere and passionate.\nBelow are a few points that struck me, with my reading notes.\n“Before 30, I advocate no house, no car, no marriage. Embrace the sharing economy, and invest most of your time, money, and energy into self‑improvement, growth, and spiritual freedom.”\nThe opening line hits hard.\nOwning a home, a car, and a stable relationship is indeed a blessing. But for most people before 30, both material conditions and psychological maturity are still limited.\nIn China, good property is concentrated in tier‑one cities and easily priced above 3 million RMB—draining “six pockets.” Putting a heavy chain on young people too early kills possibilities. Renting in big cities, staying close to fast‑moving industries, and turning education into opportunity is still a realistic path.\nI worked in Beijing for nearly six years and lived near work, commuting mostly by e‑scooter. Slightly higher rent bought shorter commutes and no subway crush. The saved time and energy went to more meaningful things. Later, because of dispersed commutes, I chose a midpoint and returned to Beijing’s crowded subways. It was miserable—no seats, no standing room, and a carriage full of exhausted faces.\nCars are just transportation for most, but young people often take loans for face. Marriage is an extremely important life decision. Munger said partner relationships require long‑term investment because they may last a lifetime. Good intimacy is priceless: it holds you in adversity and pulls you back in prosperity.\nBut relationships need practice. School suppresses early romance, yet the social clock suddenly pushes marriage and kids. My reading is that Sun’s point is: temporary poverty isn’t scary. What is scary is being swept by consumerism, stacking leverage unknowingly, and ending up living with someone you don’t even like.\nAll burdens eventually limit one serious question:\nWhat kind of life do I want?\n“People underestimate how oppressive China’s education value system is for youth… Only those with the courage to break rules can reshape an industry. Obedient girls and boys rarely start businesses, because their first instinct is to comply.”\nSuppressing individuality is a clear feature of the system. If you’re obedient at home, at school, and at work, you’re labeled “good,” maybe even “excellent.” The system is good at producing standardized talent and rarely helps you discover what suits you.\nWe should also separate “not obedient” from “not practical.” Obedience doesn’t necessarily lead to empty talk.\n“Making peace is not betraying what you once insisted on; it consolidates the phased gains of rebellion.”\nEasy to miss, but important.\nHe says he was rebellious in high school and didn’t want the college entrance exam, with poor grades. Later he realized its importance and went all‑in in senior year. Without early rebellion, he wouldn’t have joined the New Concept Writing Contest or won first prize. But without later reconciliation, he wouldn’t have entered the exam system or the path after it.\nMy takeaway: when your personal energy isn’t enough to shake rules, preserve strength and complete system‑set goals at low cost. Win stage rewards, then use those chips for a bigger future.\n“Economic independence lets parents bear less burden… If you can negotiate from that, parents may reduce control and reach reconciliation.”\nI stopped asking my family for money right after college. Partly to respect how hard they worked, partly to trade economic independence for more freedom. It worked.\nFrom boarding school to out‑of‑town college to Beijing work, I had to make life‑detail choices early. My first salary was real discretionary income. After a short “spend‑all” period, I started saving and investing—mostly capital‑protected products, basically risk‑averse.\nLater, after touching stocks and derivatives, I learned to view losses rationally. You only gain the most expensive experience by putting money on the line, as long as risk is controlled. Economic independence ends “physical weaning” and loosens relationships.\n“Effort by itself means nothing; its meaning shows only in the value and results you bring to others.”\n“Graduates from top schools still believe scores are the only fair metric… They think family background, looks, social ability, EQ, and grit are unfair, and wish there were still an exam that decides everything.”\nTogether, these statements feel absolute, but they point to reality: the outside world can’t observe your internal effort, only results. Drucker said knowledge workers must learn packaging, because knowledge labor is hard to measure.\nEmpowerment is really about translating your value into a form useful to others. Only then does the payoff appear.\nThe second quote is the “test‑taker mindset.” I resisted social variables for a long time, then realized learning ability is only one dimension in a multi‑factor model. After the exam, scores expire quickly. We enter an adult world priced by comprehensive strength—family resources, expression, networking all count.\n“Adulthood is not age, but the first time you make a subjective choice and accept its cost.”\n“Courage itself is a huge competitive advantage. If you dare to do what others won’t, you’ve already eliminated many people. Courage carries scope; big scope, big boldness.”\nCourage and resilience are rare. I lack them too. That’s why I respect people who dare to think, dare to do, and complete the path.\nOne last question:\nSun once thought 6,000 RMB per BTC was already high. Now everyone talks about a million dollars. The real question is: if that day ever comes, how many people can truly hold through it?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/wx-20260124-2fc18d/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/wechat/wx-20260124-2fc18d/img-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"2341\" /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunology has been a small trend on X again, and Sun Yuchen’s book \u003cem\u003eThe World Is Both Cruel and Gentle\u003c/em\u003e resurfaced on WeRead.

Before that, I have to go back to 2017. I left a company in Hangzhou for Beijing because the internet opportunities I wanted were there. Even earlier, in 2015, I did a summer internship in Beijing and experienced the subway crush. I rented a windowless room in Beiyuan for 1,500 RMB a month; with the light off, day and night were the same. I remember thinking: I probably won’t work for a Beijing company again. The city felt too harsh.\nAfter graduation I actually did look only at Hangzhou. Back then it wasn’t a “trendy city,” and people mostly talked about real estate, while I wanted to build interesting products. I’ve always been drawn to social/community products. A friend I knew went to Beijing and kept sending back high‑energy stories, full of anticipation and a surfer’s excitement. In 2017, I went too and talked to almost every hot community company: Keep (self‑discipline), Momo (from dating to entertainment), and Huoshan (taking on Kuaishou). Huoshan was a star then—budgets were big, good content could be exchanged for “firepower,” and firepower could be monetized. Many of those interviewers later became industry leaders, and I made some good connections during that period.\nI’ve never been able to accept the “big/small week” schedule, so for a long time I refused companies that did it. I actually held that line, and usually only joined after it was canceled. The cost was missing some high‑growth windows. Looking back, that’s hindsight. Not every hour of overtime pays high leverage; a lot of it is just consumption.\nThis time I thought about those years because I had a long conversation with an old friend in Hangzhou—almost like a ten‑year appointment. We talk nearly every year, updating each other. He successfully left Beijing, settled in Hangzhou, got married, and just became a father. I’m genuinely happy for him. He went from a high‑leverage, “career surfer” to someone deeply at peace with himself.\nIn this circle, stories like that are common. Some people join an early platform and ride a rocket. The more extreme the success, the more it attracts young people. He shared a similar example with details: early raises and data growth create strong positive feedback; you don’t need willpower to push. The long‑run stage is supported by real money—“financial freedom” isn’t just a slogan. But at the starting point, his joining was still full of randomness, so the conversation naturally drifted to “fate, luck, and timing.”\nWe both know we’re not the type to survive long‑term in big‑company pressure cookers. I told him about times when I failed to manage work emotions and carried them into life. He understood instantly and called it a pathological state. He went through something similar—coming home irritable and living in the eye of a storm. So we compared notes on our “conditions.”\nI also told him about some offers I have, and he gave advice. But we both know that many choices mean walking back into the storm. Sometimes I can’t help thinking: if family could offer more support, maybe it wouldn’t be this hard. But that topic is always difficult; every family has its own troubles.\nKids from ordinary families often solve tests to enter big cities, then join internet companies for initial capital. The next invisible tax is high housing prices. Some get trapped; some step back. He chose Hangzhou—a city with housing prices within his means and still enough job options. The premise of peace is always within one’s capacity. Options like international schools are ruled out once you see the price. I joked that when money is really needed, as parents we’ll probably still “grind” ourselves. True peace requires strong self‑awareness, discipline, and a deeper understanding of happiness.\nAnother item on this trip: an AI hackathon hosted by Guancha community. I went on Saturday; the demos and voting were on Sunday, so I mostly soaked in the atmosphere. Vibe coding compresses the idea‑to‑demo cycle to the extreme. Many ideas that used to die because of cost or technical barriers can now be prototyped with AI. I went hoping to see different people and things and add some freshness to an otherwise flat life. The venue wasn’t that lively, and the staff looked tired—maybe I came at the wrong time.\nOne booth that caught my attention was an AI‑driven custom perfume project. You input key info and the AI produces a formula to craft a personalized scent. It’s rough right now—nickname, gender, zodiac—but I like the story. Perfume is inherently personal; different occasions, outfits, moods need different scents. The project tries to replace the traditional perfumer with AI.\nThey’re now expanding via agents. The tech has no obvious moat, so they’ll rely on brand + franchising for profit. It’s essentially a one‑stop solution with branding: perfume supply, formula tech, sales channels, and service. For me, it’s also a lens to spot bubbles. The more straightforward the business model, the more worth taking seriously. If something looks bubbly but has a clear money‑making logic, that bubble may actually be worth a bet.\nAnother item: Texas Hold’em. A friend said poker bars have opened in Hangzhou. The model is: recharge for drink cards and points, points can be exchanged for chips or items, but the exchange rate is bad. Essentially, you can deposit fiat but not withdraw—profit is captured at the conversion point. For bars, gamified gambling increases recharges and drink sales; alcohol has high margins.\nIt had been five or six years since I last played. This time I learned on the fly. I’ve always thought Hold’em is a typical “three‑reading” sport: read the cards, read the people, read yourself.\nReading the cards means seeing your actual odds and whether the conditions allow a big outcome. Reading people means judging if opponents are steady, bluff‑heavy, or something else. Reading yourself means recognizing impulse and greed. At first I was impatient; my chips went to zero several times. It felt like a 0‑to‑1 innovation project: low odds, huge imagination, easy to get addicted.\nLater I realized winners on the table share two traits: strong hole cards and bold betting at key moments to win outsized returns. A few bets can double chips and clear the table. It reminded me of Duan Yongping’s line: in familiar, high‑certainty tracks, dare to bet—and bet big. It also reminded me of the “ten punches” theory: you only get ten bets in life, each a tenth of your chips. At least you don’t shoot blindly and bleed energy.\nAt the table, zeroing out means you can recharge. In life and career, zeroing out costs much more. So after the last recharge, I made a rule: don’t leave the table. That strategy kept me in the game for a long time, and I saw many people bust. I only bet big when the odds were overwhelmingly in my favor. The win rate wasn’t high, but when I won, I won big. Small losses are fine; folding is fine. The truly good outcome only needs to happen once.\nIn just two days in Hangzhou, I saw more people than I did in the whole past year.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/wx-20260120-ee5862/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m recording this weekend in Hangzhou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I was here was a year ago for interviews.

It doesn’t create leverage.\nTrading with your own capital and “scaling up” is, in most cases, an illusion.\nOnly inside institutions and systems does leverage truly exist.\nFor years, “media” and “code” were pitched as leverage for ordinary people (Naval’s Almanack). In the early dividend years, that wasn’t entirely wrong. Code did allow value to be copied at low marginal cost, and self‑media once did amplify individual influence.\nBut the problem is:\nLeverage has a time window.\nWhen writing becomes standardized labor, when revenue depends on how many ads you take, when creation feels like submitting tasks to a platform, then it’s no longer leverage. It’s just another form of wage work.\nNow the same story is replaying with AI. AI is called the next big opportunity, so we see endless content teaching AI, talking about AI, sharing AI.\nBut if it’s only glanced at, liked, and forgotten, if it doesn’t enter decisions or earn trust, then it’s a short‑term dividend, not long‑term leverage.\nSo one thing is becoming clear to me:\nWriting for the public and writing for decision‑makers are two completely different things.\nThe first solves for exposure. The second solves for adoption.\nFollowing that logic, I’ve realized that for most knowledge workers, writing slides (PPT) is also a form of writing— not for beauty, but to explain complex problems clearly in limited time and influence judgment.\nDigital nomads, KOLs, independent traders, creators, AI bloggers… These “free” identities are often just different labels for gig work. In good markets you don’t notice the difference; in bad markets the cracks show instantly.\nA simple ending:\nThe hardest part isn’t choosing a road. It’s being honest with yourself.\nSome choices are packaged as new and cool, but reality won’t be kinder just because you’re young, or because you caught a trend.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/wx-20260111-1c6c57/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA friend joked recently:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On WeChat, there are more people writing than people reading.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounds like a meme, but it isn’t that far off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is more and more content, yet what gets read, trusted, and remembered keeps shrinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that context, I put writing, trading, and “leverage” on the same table again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people believe writing as a KOL can make money,\nlike believing that a Chinese‑lit degree makes you a writer.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Illusion of Leverage"},{"content":"Today I saw a news item about an app with a jarring name climbing to the top of the download charts. It’s called “Dead Yet?” The first time most people see the name, they frown—it feels awkward.\nBut when I thought about it, it actually felt… normal.\nThis app isn’t really about “arranging your death.” It’s simple: set an emergency contact, then check in daily with one tap. If you stop checking in for several days, the system notifies your emergency contact. It’s basically a daily safety‑status reminder, especially for people who live alone or travel often.\nI once thought seriously about a similar idea—not from fear of death, but from a very ordinary trigger.\nWhile organizing my asset allocation, I suddenly realized how many accounts and platforms only I understand. If the path is broken, no one can access them. If something happens, my parents might know these assets exist but have no idea where to start.\nThat thought felt unsettling.\nLater I整理 the key information, contacts, and account paths. Some might call it “writing a will,” but for me it’s more like a memo to myself. Not to leave inheritance, nor to rehearse the worst case—just to ensure that what only I understand doesn’t become a black box for others.\nThen I asked myself:\nIf I were really gone, would that money matter to my parents?\nProbably not.\nThey may not even want to touch it. What I really worry about is not “whether the money will be used,” but that in an already painful moment, they’d have to face a pile of unfamiliar things with no explanation.\nSeen this way, “Dead Yet?” is over‑interpreted. It isn’t a pessimistic tool or a “death game.” It’s a mechanism that makes daily safety visible.\nPeople download it not because they’re obsessed with death, but because in a hyper‑digital world, information is scattered and the people who need to back you up often know the least. In that structure,整理 key things is a very normal reaction.\nOne line still matters:\nHealth and safety are always number one.\nThese discussions and preparations should not amplify risk.

By monitoring progress and feelings and allocating attention like a portfolio, it’s more effective than a random to‑do list.\nIf I get more insights, I’ll share later. Today’s notes come from a sub‑task in my “cognition account.”\n1) Distribution for Homogeneous AI Apps A friend’s blunt question stuck with me: why are you still thinking in platform logic?\nIn the AI era, a more realistic approach for individuals is to amplify existing strengths and serve a specific group well. Maybe we should gradually abandon the mass‑platform mindset. If you keep circling the old logic, you probably haven’t truly found your target users or needs.\n2) Don’t All‑in High Risk, and Don’t Lock Yourself by Fear This line feels important lately. By the way, AI is really good at comforting people.\nGPT gives me “correct but empty” planning advice, yet it does ease emotions sometimes.\n3) Comparison Creates Judgment Without comparison, everything feels fuzzy and intuition isn’t enough.\nI’m slowly realizing that in past choices, what I lacked wasn’t effort, but judgment. Choice often matters more than effort, and learning to choose well may be a life‑long task. Strong people have more options; for me, at least I need to compare so I can distinguish the better from the second‑best.\nA Podcast I Listened To Guest: Liu Ye, CEO of Zuoyebang, a serial entrepreneur.\nA headhunter recently introduced his new project Talkit—an AI × 3D virtual world for speaking practice. Wealth + idealism often lead people to life sciences or education.\nI saw comments calling him “pretentious,” but after listening, I felt his expression was quite sincere.\nSome notes that stayed with me:\nEntrepreneurship mindset: “the sea of suffering isn’t suffering.” When you see a blue ocean clearly, the current hardship hurts less. Advice to AI founders: beware of “fake opportunity” anxiety. Real opportunities are few and require time to find. Embrace solitude. Don’t fear that only you can see what you’re doing; solitude often means scarcity. “Only by making mistakes can you spend time with yourself and learn what’s right.” The best way to dissolve regret is to do something better than before. I also tried the product. It’s been polished for two years and is only about 30 points out of 100, but already ready for users—fair assessment.\nDuolingo feels like a game that wraps language learning. Speaking practice needs to overcome fear and actually speak.\nLately I practice speaking with Doubao to keep a language feel.

It’s mainly for daily observations and life notes. Happy New Year.\nSorry—it’s not me. I did a basic checkup in September. The “working‑ox indicators” were fine, but my mental state felt shaky.\nI don’t sell anxiety. I am the anxiety.\nOn the second day of 2026, I took my parents to review their checkup results in detail—another big filial‑piety play.\nTheir last checkup was in 2022, right before I quit to go abroad. The old saying goes: when your parents are alive, don’t travel far; if you do, have a plan. That checkup was my way of taking stock before leaving, easing the guilt and anxiety of going far away.\nEven when I was grinding in Beijing, I tried to go home every 2–3 months. But my parents rarely told me much. They assumed I was busy out there (I wasn’t always), and didn’t want to interrupt. The results were okay, so I left.\nThis year, remote work freed me from location constraints, and I have more time to stay at home.\nI still go out each month to “see real people” so I feel connected to the world, but it’s hard to find a place that forms a minimal closed loop: either I sleep poorly or can’t find a gym.\nAt home, I can build a tight 2‑kilometer loop of gym + library + coffee shop. It’s efficient and regular. Credit to Ningbo’s planning and infrastructure. The only drawback is the food.\nSome things in the second half of last year changed how I see myself.\nMaybe I should shift my attention from chasing my own desires to focusing on the people and things around me. For now, my takeaway is: introspection is not as good as action.\nLearn by doing, because staring at my breath all day would drive me crazy.\nLike the story of “The Moon and Sixpence,” when we pick up the sixpence on the ground, we shouldn’t forget to look up at the moon.\nI noticed my mother’s white hair blowing like snow. My father’s cigarette‑butt bonsai felt like a quiet confession of anxiety.\nLiving together daily, yet still focused on my own stuff—I felt guilty. So I arranged another checkup.\nWe already got the full report last week and planned to go on the 1st. But my dad said visiting the hospital on New Year’s Day is unlucky.\nMy mom had already asked Doubao about the report and whether her medications were appropriate. I also set up an Ant A‑Fu profile for them; it analyzed the report and gave suggestions.\nAI is rapidly changing life. If I could choose one area to be transformed, it would be healthcare.\nHospitals are packed during holidays. Many people travel far to top‑tier hospitals. Most are workers who only have time to service their “parts” on holidays.\nLab tests often take time, so you have to make multiple trips.\nCompared with the cumbersome traditional process, AI doctors win trust with friendly, simple conversations. My mom praised Doubao’s patience and detail more than once.\nOf course, I reminded her it’s just a reference.\nDoubao also tries to please you. If you’re cautious, it suggests cautious medication and extra tests, which can create unnecessary worry.\nWe booked a general clinic, like a family doctor. The doctor reviewed each indicator and mainly made suggestions and referrals.\nOverall, the doctor’s judgment was close to Doubao’s.\nMaybe it’s the GP role or the doctor’s style, but this doctor framed things more seriously, perhaps to get patients to pay attention.\nCompared with doctors who say “it’s nothing, just recheck,” this isn’t that friendly for older people, who naturally don’t like being told they’re unhealthy.\nI didn’t mind. Signals matter—they’re the start of a process. But it’s hard to tell which words are truly “right,” nice or harsh.\nSo… ask Doubao more.\nBoth of them have some hypertension. My dad also has abnormal lipid and kidney indicators, so he was referred to cardiology and nephrology.\nWe met one “empty‑headed” doctor and one “grumpy” doctor.\nThe first prescribed basic meds and said to observe; he didn’t like to communicate much.\nThe “grumpy” doctor reviewed past records and meds and inferred the kidney issue might be tied to an older blood‑pressure drug.\nShe suggested a controlled‑variable approach: stop the current med that may burden the kidneys, switch to a gentler plan, and recheck in a month.\nIf it’s still significant, hospitalization and a biopsy might be needed.\nWe got nervous at “hospitalization.” I felt suddenly humble in my blind spot and hoped for more guidance.\nIt made me think about relationships. We can’t wait for problems and then hope for miracles. Having doctor friends may not change much, but it helps you feel safe.\nFaced with a rainbow of indicators, I didn’t even tell my dad to quit smoking and drinking. I used to preach and shout slogans—now I don’t think it works. Better to say: drink less, keep it moderate, and use indicators as monitoring.\nWhen he sees those arrows, he isn’t happy. Forcing abstinence can backfire.\nIn the end, huge respect for medical insurance and all healthcare workers.\nWith insurance, my parents aren’t afraid to go to hospitals. What I can do is accompany them emotionally, review regularly, and keep pushing.\nIt’s also because of insurance that people run to hospitals for small issues. The volume is huge, and doctors and nurses are exhausted.\nI can’t imagine working in that environment every day. There are few smiles—mostly worry, fatigue, and anxiety.\nEven waiting in chairs for our number felt draining.\nAnd honestly, thank you, AI—especially Doubao.\nI sometimes joke that when I work, short videos keep my parents in a flow state.\nDoubao’s arrival made my mom fall in love with asking questions. She’s no longer afraid to ask “silly” things because it’s always patient.\nShe’s also willing to read more, because the structured explanations are easy to follow.\nI saw a curiosity in my mom that might be even stronger than mine.\nYour fifties are a great age for curiosity.\nI hope AI continues to level access to knowledge—bringing ordinary people closer to knowledge and farther from套路.\nOn the way home, we watched roads being rebuilt and widened, and chatted about housing and stability. I’ve learned to block those conversations with health indicators.\nBecause for ordinary people, a qualified checkup report may be the only certainty in an uncertain era.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/wx-20260102-a37d32/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: because of real‑name verification issues, the original “Seventh” account will be repurposed as my personal account.

Europe’s strengths lie in fundamental sciences and traditional industries, which created a certain dependence on industry. The current internet landscape in Europe feels more like China ten years ago—going through “Internet+” digitalization and mobile transformation. But because of fragmented markets and regulatory constraints, it’s hard for monopoly‑style giants to emerge. This matches my impression of European companies: small, beautiful, focused.\nAs a result, European internet firms focus more on B2B products like SaaS that serve many local SMEs. Consumer internet (social, e‑commerce) is still early, which ironically leaves room for global giants to expand.\nEurope never lacks technical talent—Python, Linux, and the World Wide Web all originated here. The irony is that Europeans still rely heavily on American products for information and social usage (Instagram, Google), while China’s TikTok has everyone scrolling short videos.\nIn terms of internet prospects, most energy is concentrated in the US and China. The US leads with technical transformation and business model innovation, focusing on product design and business models. China often benchmarks the US but adapts to local conditions; its advantages are operational ability and offline channels, plus a “Great Wall” moat. Still, China is developing its own strengths. One sentence: China is a high‑speed experimental field. It’s the world’s largest unified market (language, currency, consumption habits), with a huge basic‑education dividend. That’s why foreign companies once rushed into China. Capital goes where returns are, and that won’t change soon.\nI don’t speak local languages, and I don’t fully understand these markets or user habits. I can only apply basic frameworks, which clearly doesn’t leave a deep impression. Still, I decided to try. Before this, my work and study were focused on China. As a user‑facing PM, you must understand users and markets to identify pain points, solve them with standardized products, and scale through iteration and distribution. Internet products’ biggest advantage is low marginal cost; scale increases returns. Those strengths are hard to apply in Europe.\nChoosing Target Companies After initial analysis, I focused on internationalized internet companies. Their culture is more diverse and closer to my experience, and they need international talent—though that also means competing with strong candidates from around the world.\nI’ll use Berlin‑based GetYourGuide (GYG) as a case study. The whole process took about two months, and I was rejected in the co‑founder interview.\nCompany Selection \u0026amp; Background Research Visa is critical. Many companies filter out most international candidates based on resume and visa status. SMEs especially dislike the extra cost—both the time and salary cost—of sponsoring visas. So choose companies willing to sponsor; they usually state this in job postings.\n“Destination travel” was new to me; in simple terms, it’s like local guides or ticket middlemen. GYG acts as a broker; one founder is Chinese, which may imply Chinese capital and internet DNA. That gave me a small résumé fit advantage.\nAlthough I had no travel‑industry experience, the essence of internet products is traffic. Mainstream business models—ads, e‑commerce, gaming—work anywhere. GYG looks like a commission‑based e‑commerce model but depends heavily on offline resources and is a niche track. Unlike OTAs (Booking, TripAdvisor) with higher margins, GYG’s profit space is limited, and it’s not like food delivery platforms with low margin and huge scale.\nGYG was founded in 2009, earlier than many Chinese internet companies. ByteDance, for example, was founded in 2012 and is now a global entertainment “product factory” and “time black hole.” GYG is moving toward mobile app transformation and is relatively advanced compared to peers still focused on web. This also relates to its acquisition strategy that relies heavily on Google search.\nAfter comparison, I believed the company and role fit my background. Similar targets included Booking and Airbnb, so it was worth trying.\nResume Preparation \u0026amp; Optimization Before applying, I prepared several general English resumes. By packaging past experience and aligning with the role, I tried to help European recruiters quickly see my background, capability, and fit. I realized the power of big‑platform brands. Labels like “ByteDance,” “TikTok,” and “Baidu,” even if not as famous as FAANG, draw far more attention than unknown companies.\nThe core of a resume is fit. If your experience is close to the role’s business model, you can ramp faster. So it matters to express your strengths clearly using STAR, and to be confident without exaggeration. At this stage, I wasn’t just representing myself—ByteDance’s label was also backing me.\nAnother surprise: European companies value cover letters far more than I expected. Some roles even require one. This formalism is exhausting for mass‑applications. Without ChatGPT, most energy would go into cover letters.\nInitial Screening (HR) I applied via LinkedIn and company sites. But Europe strongly values referrals and networks. Some roles are filled from internal pools; only when internal channels fail do they go public. Good opportunities are scarce—filled internally or by referral; only then do they “race” in the open market.\nI applied for a growth‑traffic role. Although it required Google SEO expertise, I aligned my Baidu experience because the logic is similar. I hadn’t worked directly with Google SEO/SEM, but I couldn’t expect them to use Baidu either.\nLuckily I passed the resume screen and got an HR call. In China, HR often has limited power and mostly collects info and schedules interviews (except in companies like Alibaba where HR plays a stronger role). In Europe, the HR screen felt as rigorous as a final HR round at Alibaba.\nThey usually start with small talk to assess language and communication, then ask basic questions to evaluate background, cultural values, and visa needs. They care about motivation and value alignment. By stereotype, white female HRs often rejected me—why, I don’t know. My instinct is that, as an international candidate, without strong reasons, European firms prefer local PMs.\nThis time, the interviewer was a white male HR. I was well prepared, expressed fit, and proposed solutions based on their needs. Maybe after many failures I was more fluent; maybe the screen was looser. Either way, I moved forward and started the painful interview journey.\n(To be continued…)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/tech/gyg-interview-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eToday I’m reviewing my experience finding a product manager job in Europe.

You don’t need to own the asset; you just predict price movements and speculate on the spread. I learned the hard way that in this market, the strongest capital often decides the direction.\nInstant Feedback and Emotional Swings One of futures trading’s biggest attractions is speed of feedback. Every minute, even every second, price movements affect your PnL. It’s like the instant feedback of short videos—an upgraded form of “numbing pleasure,” except the feedback is money up or down.\nThat speed is addictive. When you lose, you think, “If I try again, maybe the market will give me a chance.” When you win, excitement makes you reckless: “One more bet.” Often that extra bet causes the final loss. Watching the K‑line feels like a roller coaster—euphoria on the way up, panic on the way down. You want to stop and calm down, but desire pulls you deeper.\nRational vs. Irrational Judgment I used to obsess over charts and support/resistance. Then I learned: in futures markets, technical analysis can be window dressing. The real drivers are “operators” and big money. Each time I bought or sold with confidence, the market refused to follow my script. Sometimes violent moves were simply games of capital—intentions that no chart could predict.\nFutures prices don’t rely solely on fundamentals or technicals. They’re driven more by capital flows and manipulation. In a large game, you and I are just pieces. We think we’re making decisions, but big money has already laid the board. Every rally or crash can be a carefully designed trap, and we’re just participants—lured in or forced out.\nRetail Limits and Mental Training As retail, I know my limits. Leverage doesn’t just amplify gains, it amplifies risk. You think you’ve caught the rhythm, but a single swing can trap you. No matter how accurate your analysis feels, it can’t resist the force of big money. The harder you try to predict, the more you’re fooled by false signals. Every wrong judgment becomes a costly lesson.\nWorse, emotions drive decisions. I know the market may keep falling, but a small bounce makes me buy. When it rises, I fear missing out and keep adding. After losses, regret and anxiety torture me: “If I had shorted, I could have avoided this.” That regret creates a loop. Every unwilling attempt drains confidence.\nSpeculation as a Battle With Yourself The essence of futures trading isn’t a battle with the market—it’s a battle with greed and fear. Every buy or sell tests your judgment, patience, and risk tolerance. You watch the market and wrestle your own emotions. A good strategy helps, but what decides the outcome is always your mental state.\nHere, reason and emotion alternate constantly. Reason tells you to short, but as the market rises, emotion doubts you and wants to go long. Fear tells you to cut losses, but greed makes you hold. This inner battle never stops, and capital gets burned in the process.\nAt this point, anyone who isn’t the house yet still plays with big leverage is truly fierce.\nAnd I’m just a leek.\n(Compiled by AI)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/tech/%E5%90%88%E7%BA%A6%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E9%9F%AD%E8%8F%9C%E5%BF%83%E7%90%86/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAt first I thought futures trading was just a toy for a small group of high‑risk crypto players, while spot was the “mainstream.” After getting involved, I realized I was wrong.

It’s a good question. Futures trading is about predicting price movements, while gambling is betting on uncertain outcomes. They sound similar, but the logic is different. I also encountered prediction markets like Polymarket, which feel related. Below is a quick整理 of the similarities and differences between futures trading, gambling, prediction markets, and traditional financial derivatives.\n1. Futures Trading vs. Gambling: Similarities and Differences Similarities Risk and uncertainty: both are uncertain. Futures prices swing with news and events; gambling outcomes are also random. Leverage: leverage amplifies both gains and losses, just like bigger bets in gambling. Differences Analysis and strategy: futures trading isn’t purely luck. You can use technical analysis and data. Gambling—especially pure casino games—is almost entirely luck. Risk control: futures allow stop‑loss and take‑profit tools. Gambling rarely has such controls; the house advantage is built into the rules. Long‑term profitability: with a solid strategy and risk management, long‑term profitability is possible. Gambling is negative‑sum for the gambler over time. So while both can bring fast gains or losses in the short term, futures trading can reduce loss and improve odds through strategy; gambling relies on luck.\n2. Polymarket vs. Futures Trading Polymarket is a prediction market where users bet on future events (e.g., election outcomes, sports results). The core is event probability, not price fluctuations.\nPrediction markets: you bet on whether an event happens. Futures trading: you predict the price path of an asset (BTC, stocks, etc.). Both involve forecasting, but the focus is different: events vs. prices.\n3. Traditional Finance Analogues: Derivatives Traditional finance has instruments similar to crypto futures—derivatives whose value depends on underlying price movements.\nFutures Contracts You agree to buy or sell an asset at a set price in the future. Widely used in commodities, indices, and FX.\nSimilarity: allows long/short and leverage. Options Contracts Options give you the right (not the obligation) to buy or sell at a set price later. Used for hedging or speculation.\nSimilarity: based on price movement; leverage is common. Contracts for Difference (CFDs) CFDs let you trade price changes without owning the asset. Popular in stocks, FX, commodities.\nSimilarity: long/short and leverage. From these comparisons, futures trading looks much closer to traditional derivatives than to gambling. All are risky, but with analysis and risk management they can be valuable tools. Prediction markets focus on event outcomes; futures focus on price dynamics.\nIn short: futures trading isn’t “just gambling,” but it can become gambling if you ignore analysis and risk control.\n(Compiled by AI)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/tech/%E5%90%88%E7%BA%A6%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E4%B8%8E%E8%B5%8C%E5%8D%9A%E6%9C%89%E4%BD%95%E5%8C%BA%E5%88%AB%E9%A2%84%E6%B5%8B%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E5%92%8C%E4%BC%A0%E7%BB%9F%E9%87%91%E8%9E%8D%E7%9A%84%E6%AF%94%E8%BE%83-171ea51483288007888ec742b4071076/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eRecently, while studying crypto derivatives, I noticed many people ask: \u003cem\u003eIs futures trading basically gambling?\u003c/em\u003e It’s a good question.

Over the past two years, I talked about the “cliche” stories of yesterday, today, and tomorrow via podcast—usually by extracting a few keywords and expanding on them with experiences and reflections. It felt a bit like an essay prompt, but it made year‑end review easier to finish. Still, podcasts are ultimately for entertainment, because the show is made for others.\nI’ve always taken notes, but I mostly enjoy the act of recording and rarely整理 them later, unless it’s important information like account passwords. Maybe the act of writing helps memory. Or, as the old saying goes: a dull pen beats a sharp memory.\nTo be honest, it’s a little strange. I think I still need to adapt to blogging as an “old‑school” medium. When I first recorded a podcast, I had to speak to myself with emotion, and that feeling was subtle. The underlying motivation is simple: I want to share sincerely, and I believe that the sharing will eventually be seen and receive positive feedback. That, to me, is a real change the internet brought to the world. Even though the signal‑to‑noise ratio keeps dropping, the internet still gives ordinary people a chance to be heard. In a sense, as a tool to reduce information gaps, as long as I can use the internet, I can move forward a bit.\nMy 2024 Back to the year‑end review. In 2024, I traveled to many places—probably more, by countries and cities, than in the first thirty years of my life combined. As the saying goes, “Life is not a track, but a wilderness.” I feel that more deeply now, and I’ll write about it later.\nFrom the second half of 2023 to the first half of 2024, I was in Europe, and then I returned to China. In that short year, as a foreigner, it felt like playing a life‑simulation game. From renting to studying to job interviews, I went through countless challenges. I plan to write separate posts about what I saw and learned. Here I’ll focus on study and work.\nStudying in Europe After ten years, going back to the classroom felt very different—mostly because of my mindset after being polished by the real world. Internet work is all about efficiency and short‑term output, while school is more about systematic training. What kind of person you become isn’t really the school’s responsibility. At my university, international students were a minority, and most students were white locals. For locals, as long as they want to study, tuition is almost free—getting admitted is as easy as clicking “join.” I had heard that UK/US master’s programs are “cash cows,” but when I paid the fees myself, I still smiled bitterly. As someone with life experience, I can accept it: if I’m paying in a capitalist country, I’m buying experience and service. If I’m not satisfied, I can leave instead of forcing myself to adapt. Time is more precious to me.\nSome impressions:\nCliques among students are strong. It’s not exclusionary; many people have been classmates since high school or undergrad, and those relationships continue into grad school and even work. It’s a stable network society. Teaching quality varies a lot. Some professors just read slides, and nobody likes their class. Yet you’ll see them dressed sharply after class, riding their bikes, and it’s hard to tell they’re unmotivated at work. It almost makes you think they might be better than they appear in class. Learning has no age limit. I was older than many 2000s‑born classmates, but there was a local classmate in his sixties—a high‑school teacher—who believed CS and AI were the future and came back to study. I genuinely respect that (and he doesn’t need to pay tuition). Course content and knowledge systems feel somewhat dated. Influenced by China’s fast internet growth, I sensed Europe’s internet strengths are limited. Infrastructure and awareness are often behind; even a Xiaomi smart‑home setup can impress people here. China and the US are truly two flowers blooming together in tech. As a foreigner, going to a diverse place matters. Accept that you are different, but also remember we are all ordinary people; skin color and cultural background are the only differences. Seek common ground while respecting differences. From a career perspective, an internationalized environment offers more opportunities; only such environments create real chances for foreigners. Working in Europe Unlike the fast‑paced job search in China, I followed the European process step by step. From resume, to role selection, to application, to interviews—each step, easy in China, became a tougher challenge in Europe. The job market is stable with more permanent contracts and high layoff costs, so companies hire cautiously, especially for non‑EU candidates. Referrals matter a lot, and this differs from China. In China, internal referrals are often just fast resume forwarding with quick feedback and easy iteration. In Europe, hiring cycles are longer and more strict. They care about “fit,” and when visas add cost, foreign candidates are disadvantaged. I’ll write a separate post about my job search later.\nTraveling in Europe One big perk of studying in Europe is the Schengen visa. The EU creates a near borderless travel experience; with a residence card, you can cross countries with almost no checks. Low‑cost flights let you hop between language regions as easily as traveling between provinces in China. Christianity once unified European culture, yet strong local identities remain—language and customs vary widely. I didn’t visit many places: mostly Southern Europe (Spain, Italy), Central Europe (Hungary, Czech Republic, Austria), and parts of Western Europe like Benelux. I still haven’t been to Northern Europe or Switzerland—maybe after saving more.\nJob Search After Returning to China After returning, I continued job hunting. The experience in Europe made me more professional; my performance in China felt more mature than before. I learned to analyze fit around each role and to “speak nicely,” hiding some real thoughts. In Europe, as a foreigner, I had to show high fit and strong intent to keep moving forward. Back home, even with education and big‑company experience, competition was fierce, so I leaned into a more professional performance and a more positive, optimistic attitude.\nEntering Web3 After a long and serious job search, I ended up with a few offers and chose my current Web3 company. Beyond the advantages of remote work, I saw it as a bridge into Web3. I met many excellent people and gained information similar to—but also different from—the traditional internet world.\nI’m still a beginner in Web3. I hope to use my Web2 experience to anchor myself here and better understand how the industry and the world work. I also want to keep learning new things, because only new knowledge brings growth, hope, and possibility.\n2024 was an exceptionally hard year. The future is uncertain, but I’ll keep moving forward—without looking back.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/2024/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-the-internet-and-blogging\"\u003eAbout the Internet and Blogging\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t think I’ve ever documented a year through public writing.

At that juncture, freshly embarking on my career, I was grappling with life’s profound questions. These ruminations have resurfaced, echoing the present day as I confront a spate of lukewarm responses to my job applications across Europe and the fatigue of cultural assimilation. Amidst this, I recognize an acute need for stillness, self-reflection, and a constructive approach to life’s hurdles. Vipassana has, once again, become my sanctuary.\nNavigating the Job Market’s Choppy Waters In my quest for growth, I’ve found myself ensnared in a conundrum, having cast a wide net for product manager roles throughout Europe—primarily in Germany and the Netherlands. Regrettably, invitations to interview are rare, and on the occasion they do arise, the specter of visa issues often leads to doors closing. It’s a rational preference, from a corporate standpoint, to opt for local talent, particularly in roles demanding an intimate comprehension of user behaviors and preferences in order to sculpt features that resonate deeply.\nNevertheless, these setbacks have not quelled my spirit. Each interview serves as a crucible for personal and professional refinement. My perseverance harks back to the days of Vipassana.\nThe Art of Stillness Amidst the Noise The essence of Vipassana transcends borders, with myriad interpretations around the globe. At its core, “super-seeing” defines it, yet most embrace it as a pathway to “insight” or “clear-seeing”—a journey inward rather than an examination of our external reality. Its parallels with meditation are uncanny; both are bastions of focus and serenity. I’ve come to regard it as ‘the art of stillness.’ Embracing Vipassana means forgoing the digital chatter of modernity for contemplation; a world where silence reigns, and the rhythm of one’s breath becomes the sole focus, devoid of even the most transient of eye contacts. This is the practice of severing ties with the tumult of the external world to delve into the self.\nA Glimpse of Vipassana: The Beginning of a Journey Fast forward a year, and I found myself in a startup’s dynamic crucible, though the winds of change were tapering off, with competition outpacing us. Once ordered, our management descended into disarray. As a junior product manager, I was privy to the CEO’s vision—initiatives that seemed potent at inception. Yet, I pondered if our trajectory truly aligned with our user’s desires or merely mirrored executive conjecture. Caught between acquiescence and skepticism, I sought clarity through Vipassana, compelling me to apply for leave. In an unexpected gesture, my CEO bestowed upon me a Buddhist sutra—a harbinger of the introspective journey ahead.\nAdmitting to a flicker of skepticism—courtesy of their antiquated online presence—I decided to lean into the unfamiliar, spurred by a youthful zest for transformative experiences that promised an escape from the ennui of routine.\n(To be continued…)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/embracing-serenity-in-the-storm_1/","summary":"Join me as I recount my transformative ten-day Vipassana experience and draw parallels to the current challenges I face with job applications in Europe.

I applied for some time off, flew to a different city, and ventured to an obscure mountain with my luggage in tow. Opting to hike to the summit instead of taking a bus, I felt my journey had truly begun with that choice. Upon arrival, I noticed I was among the youngest attendees; surrounded mostly by individuals who could be uncles and aunts. Their surprise was palpable — perhaps, from their vantage point, a young man like me shouldn’t be burdened by significant troubles. Yet, it was curiosity more than anxiety that propelled me forward. I saw this as a cool adventure and a potential release from work stress.\nThe Art of Letting Go Upon arrival, we were required to surrender all our belongings to the organization, including cash and mobile phones. I joked to myself that if I were to be kidnapped, no one would know. Thankfully, this was an official and trustworthy organization. With the retreat starting the next day, our first evening involved watching a documentary on Vipassana before retiring early at 9 p.m.\nA Day of New Beginnings The regimen for the next ten days was stringent, spanning from 4 a.m. to 9 p.m., a schedule unheard of in bustling city life. Unsurprisingly, my first night was restless, attributed to this sudden lifestyle shift and the anticipation of the days ahead.\nOn Day 1, I rose at 4:00 a.m. and embarked on my first prolonged session of cross-legged meditation. The unfamiliarity made it challenging to maintain focus on my breathing. Persevering through two hours led to a welcome breakfast break, featuring an array of delicious vegetarian dishes. The day continued in this pattern: meditate, eat, meditate, with each session proving more monotonous than I’d anticipated. Had I known the extent of the repetition, my initial enthusiasm might have waned. Yet, my resolve to complete what I had started kept me anchored.\nLessons in Mindfulness and Impermanence Despite the time that has elapsed since the retreat, the memory of leg pain and discomfort lingers vividly. That first day was a relentless cycle of redirecting my wandering mind back to my breath, interspersed with intrusive thoughts about work and life. The instructor’s advice was clear: leave external concerns outside and focus solely on breathing.\nThe essence of Vipassana became clearer when physical discomfort from prolonged sitting arose. Rather than succumbing to irritation, I learned to observe the pain without reaction, understanding that it, too, would pass. Similarly, fleeting moments of comfort or focus weren’t to be celebrated but observed with the same detachment, embodying the principle that all experiences, pleasant or unpleasant, are transient.\n(To be continued…)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/life/embracing-serenity-in-the-storm_2/","summary":"Join me as I recount my transformative ten-day Vipassana experience and draw parallels to the current challenges I face with job applications in Europe.

Yet, as we wade through the ephemeral streams of TikToks, Tweets, and status updates, the allure of a dedicated digital space—a personal website—becomes increasingly compelling. This blog post explores the why, how, and what of building a personal website amid the clamor of social media, with a lens on the Chinese digital landscape and a global perspective.\nWhy a Personal Website? China’s digital environment offers a unique vantage point. With the ubiquity of platforms like WeChat and TikTok, the idea of a personal website can feel superfluous. Yet, more people are realizing the limitations and impermanence of relying solely on social media for one’s digital identity. A personal website is a bastion of individuality and permanence in a fluid world, offering a canvas for deeper, more nuanced self‑expression.\nGlobally, the narrative isn’t very different. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram offer reach and engagement, but they operate within their own ecosystems. A personal website, by contrast, is a sanctuary of self‑sovereignty—a place where you can articulate your narrative without algorithmic whims or platform policies.\nHow to Craft Your Digital Home Creating a personal website is like building a house. It begins with a foundation: choosing a domain name that resonates with your identity. For example, I chose Aliyun for affordability but avoided their hosting to sidestep possible approval hurdles. I went with Bluehost to ensure global accessibility.\nThe soul of a website is its content—the authentic expression of thoughts, ideas, and creativity. Whether short musings or long essays, content reflects the creator. I built a WordPress site that is user‑friendly and SEO‑optimized so my voice can be heard amid internet noise.\nSecurity and speed matter, so I chose Cloudflare to improve protection and performance. From concept to launch, the process reinforced the importance of strategic planning and putting content ahead of surface aesthetics.\nReflections and Learnings This digital build has been an enlightening journey. My website evolved from a Hexo + GitHub Pages experiment into a robust WordPress + Bluehost site—proof that a website, like its creator, is always evolving.\nUsing themes like GeneratePress and tools like Elementor let me adjust aesthetics without sacrificing functionality. This iterative approach to design and content curation helped me craft a digital identity that reflects my style while resonating with a global audience.\nThe Global Digital Landscape While my website story is personal, it’s also part of a wider conversation about digital independence and identity. In a world where social media’s ephemerality often dilutes individuality, a personal website becomes a lasting record of one’s unique digital footprint.\nThrough this post, I invite you to begin your own journey. Whether you’re in China’s WeChat ecosystem or elsewhere, building a personal site is a worthy path—one that lets you assert digital sovereignty, tell your story, and leave a lasting imprint on the web.\nIn short: while the immediate reach of social media is seductive, the long‑term value of a personal website is undeniable. It’s more than a platform—it’s a digital legacy. As we move deeper into the digital age, building a website is not just a technical task, but an art of self‑expression and identity.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/tech/tech_template/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn an era dominated by the instantaneous gratification of social media, the notion of creating a personal website might seem, at first glance, like a quaint relic from a bygone digital epoch.
