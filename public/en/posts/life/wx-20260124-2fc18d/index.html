</p>
<p>Sunology has been a small trend on X again, and Sun Yuchen’s book <em>The World Is Both Cruel and Gentle</em> resurfaced on WeRead. I skimmed it and had to admit: his cognition is ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>You can criticize his ruthless marketing and the cold‑blooded moves that landed partners in prison, but it’s hard to deny that he’s often ahead, and his personal story is dramatic enough to be called inspiring.</p>
<p>The book was written in 2016. Much of it comes from blog posts and scattered thoughts, so it reads like a compilation of essays. Reading it in 2026 adds a strange “ten‑years‑later” filter.</p>
<p>He once built his first fortune by buying Bitcoin around 100 RMB and cashing out around 6,000 RMB. In the book he says 6,000 was already high and warned caution. Today, BTC’s peak has crossed 800,000 RMB. That old judgment is now strangely resonant.</p>
<p>Sun Yuchen—called “Brother Sun” or “Sun the Slicer”—is a marketing genius. He bid for a dinner with Buffett just to gift him a Bitcoin he didn’t even approve of. He makes decisions fast at banquets. Recently, he even went to space.</p>
<p>A controversial figure, mysterious and risky. Yet in the book he still feels sincere and passionate.</p>
<p>Below are a few points that struck me, with my reading notes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Before 30, I advocate no house, no car, no marriage. Embrace the sharing economy, and invest most of your time, money, and energy into self‑improvement, growth, and spiritual freedom.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opening line hits hard.</p>
<p>Owning a home, a car, and a stable relationship is indeed a blessing. But for most people before 30, both material conditions and psychological maturity are still limited.</p>
<p>In China, good property is concentrated in tier‑one cities and easily priced above 3 million RMB—draining “six pockets.” Putting a heavy chain on young people too early kills possibilities. Renting in big cities, staying close to fast‑moving industries, and turning education into opportunity is still a realistic path.</p>
<p>I worked in Beijing for nearly six years and lived near work, commuting mostly by e‑scooter. Slightly higher rent bought shorter commutes and no subway crush. The saved time and energy went to more meaningful things. Later, because of dispersed commutes, I chose a midpoint and returned to Beijing’s crowded subways. It was miserable—no seats, no standing room, and a carriage full of exhausted faces.</p>
<p>Cars are just transportation for most, but young people often take loans for face. Marriage is an extremely important life decision. Munger said partner relationships require long‑term investment because they may last a lifetime. Good intimacy is priceless: it holds you in adversity and pulls you back in prosperity.</p>
<p>But relationships need practice. School suppresses early romance, yet the social clock suddenly pushes marriage and kids. My reading is that Sun’s point is: temporary poverty isn’t scary. What is scary is being swept by consumerism, stacking leverage unknowingly, and ending up living with someone you don’t even like.</p>
<p>All burdens eventually limit one serious question:</p>
<p><em>What kind of life do I want?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People underestimate how oppressive China’s education value system is for youth… Only those with the courage to break rules can reshape an industry. Obedient girls and boys rarely start businesses, because their first instinct is to comply.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppressing individuality is a clear feature of the system. If you’re obedient at home, at school, and at work, you’re labeled “good,” maybe even “excellent.” The system is good at producing standardized talent and rarely helps you discover what suits you.</p>
<p>We should also separate “not obedient” from “not practical.” Obedience doesn’t necessarily lead to empty talk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Making peace is not betraying what you once insisted on; it consolidates the phased gains of rebellion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy to miss, but important.</p>
<p>He says he was rebellious in high school and didn’t want the college entrance exam, with poor grades. Later he realized its importance and went all‑in in senior year. Without early rebellion, he wouldn’t have joined the New Concept Writing Contest or won first prize. But without later reconciliation, he wouldn’t have entered the exam system or the path after it.</p>
<p>My takeaway: when your personal energy isn’t enough to shake rules, preserve strength and complete system‑set goals at low cost. Win stage rewards, then use those chips for a bigger future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Economic independence lets parents bear less burden… If you can negotiate from that, parents may reduce control and reach reconciliation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I stopped asking my family for money right after college. Partly to respect how hard they worked, partly to trade economic independence for more freedom. It worked.</p>
<p>From boarding school to out‑of‑town college to Beijing work, I had to make life‑detail choices early. My first salary was real discretionary income. After a short “spend‑all” period, I started saving and investing—mostly capital‑protected products, basically risk‑averse.</p>
<p>Later, after touching stocks and derivatives, I learned to view losses rationally. You only gain the most expensive experience by putting money on the line, as long as risk is controlled. Economic independence ends “physical weaning” and loosens relationships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Effort by itself means nothing; its meaning shows only in the value and results you bring to others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Graduates from top schools still believe scores are the only fair metric… They think family background, looks, social ability, EQ, and grit are unfair, and wish there were still an exam that decides everything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Together, these statements feel absolute, but they point to reality: the outside world can’t observe your internal effort, only results. Drucker said knowledge workers must learn packaging, because knowledge labor is hard to measure.</p>
<p>Empowerment is really about translating your value into a form useful to others. Only then does the payoff appear.</p>
<p>The second quote is the “test‑taker mindset.” I resisted social variables for a long time, then realized learning ability is only one dimension in a multi‑factor model. After the exam, scores expire quickly. We enter an adult world priced by comprehensive strength—family resources, expression, networking all count.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Adulthood is not age, but the first time you make a subjective choice and accept its cost.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Courage itself is a huge competitive advantage. If you dare to do what others won’t, you’ve already eliminated many people. Courage carries scope; big scope, big boldness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Courage and resilience are rare. I lack them too. That’s why I respect people who dare to think, dare to do, and complete the path.</p>
<p>One last question:</p>
<p>Sun once thought 6,000 RMB per BTC was already high. Now everyone talks about a million dollars. The real question is: if that day ever comes, how many people can truly hold through it?</p>
