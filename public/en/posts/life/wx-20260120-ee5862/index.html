  <div class="post-content"><p>I’m recording this weekend in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The last time I was here was a year ago for interviews. Before that, I have to go back to 2017. I left a company in Hangzhou for Beijing because the internet opportunities I wanted were there. Even earlier, in 2015, I did a summer internship in Beijing and experienced the subway crush. I rented a windowless room in Beiyuan for 1,500 RMB a month; with the light off, day and night were the same. I remember thinking: I probably won’t work for a Beijing company again. The city felt too harsh.</p>
<p>After graduation I actually did look only at Hangzhou. Back then it wasn’t a “trendy city,” and people mostly talked about real estate, while I wanted to build interesting products. I’ve always been drawn to social/community products. A friend I knew went to Beijing and kept sending back high‑energy stories, full of anticipation and a surfer’s excitement. In 2017, I went too and talked to almost every hot community company: Keep (self‑discipline), Momo (from dating to entertainment), and Huoshan (taking on Kuaishou). Huoshan was a star then—budgets were big, good content could be exchanged for “firepower,” and firepower could be monetized. Many of those interviewers later became industry leaders, and I made some good connections during that period.</p>
<p>I’ve never been able to accept the “big/small week” schedule, so for a long time I refused companies that did it. I actually held that line, and usually only joined after it was canceled. The cost was missing some high‑growth windows. Looking back, that’s hindsight. Not every hour of overtime pays high leverage; a lot of it is just consumption.</p>
<p>This time I thought about those years because I had a long conversation with an old friend in Hangzhou—almost like a ten‑year appointment. We talk nearly every year, updating each other. He successfully left Beijing, settled in Hangzhou, got married, and just became a father. I’m genuinely happy for him. He went from a high‑leverage, “career surfer” to someone deeply at peace with himself.</p>
<p>In this circle, stories like that are common. Some people join an early platform and ride a rocket. The more extreme the success, the more it attracts young people. He shared a similar example with details: early raises and data growth create strong positive feedback; you don’t need willpower to push. The long‑run stage is supported by real money—“financial freedom” isn’t just a slogan. But at the starting point, his joining was still full of randomness, so the conversation naturally drifted to “fate, luck, and timing.”</p>
<p>We both know we’re not the type to survive long‑term in big‑company pressure cookers. I told him about times when I failed to manage work emotions and carried them into life. He understood instantly and called it a pathological state. He went through something similar—coming home irritable and living in the eye of a storm. So we compared notes on our “conditions.”</p>
<p>I also told him about some offers I have, and he gave advice. But we both know that many choices mean walking back into the storm. Sometimes I can’t help thinking: if family could offer more support, maybe it wouldn’t be this hard. But that topic is always difficult; every family has its own troubles.</p>
<p>Kids from ordinary families often solve tests to enter big cities, then join internet companies for initial capital. The next invisible tax is high housing prices. Some get trapped; some step back. He chose Hangzhou—a city with housing prices within his means and still enough job options. The premise of peace is always within one’s capacity. Options like international schools are ruled out once you see the price. I joked that when money is really needed, as parents we’ll probably still “grind” ourselves. True peace requires strong self‑awareness, discipline, and a deeper understanding of happiness.</p>
<p>Another item on this trip: an AI hackathon hosted by Guancha community. I went on Saturday; the demos and voting were on Sunday, so I mostly soaked in the atmosphere. Vibe coding compresses the idea‑to‑demo cycle to the extreme. Many ideas that used to die because of cost or technical barriers can now be prototyped with AI. I went hoping to see different people and things and add some freshness to an otherwise flat life. The venue wasn’t that lively, and the staff looked tired—maybe I came at the wrong time.</p>

</p>
<p>One booth that caught my attention was an AI‑driven custom perfume project. You input key info and the AI produces a formula to craft a personalized scent. It’s rough right now—nickname, gender, zodiac—but I like the story. Perfume is inherently personal; different occasions, outfits, moods need different scents. The project tries to replace the traditional perfumer with AI.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wechat/wx-20260120-ee5862/img-03.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1440" />
</p>
<p>They’re now expanding via agents. The tech has no obvious moat, so they’ll rely on brand + franchising for profit. It’s essentially a one‑stop solution with branding: perfume supply, formula tech, sales channels, and service. For me, it’s also a lens to spot bubbles. The more straightforward the business model, the more worth taking seriously. If something looks bubbly but has a clear money‑making logic, that bubble may actually be worth a bet.</p>
<p>Another item: Texas Hold’em. A friend said poker bars have opened in Hangzhou. The model is: recharge for drink cards and points, points can be exchanged for chips or items, but the exchange rate is bad. Essentially, you can deposit fiat but not withdraw—profit is captured at the conversion point. For bars, gamified gambling increases recharges and drink sales; alcohol has high margins.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wechat/wx-20260120-ee5862/img-04.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1440" />
</p>
<p>It had been five or six years since I last played. This time I learned on the fly. I’ve always thought Hold’em is a typical “three‑reading” sport: read the cards, read the people, read yourself.</p>
<p>Reading the cards means seeing your actual odds and whether the conditions allow a big outcome. Reading people means judging if opponents are steady, bluff‑heavy, or something else. Reading yourself means recognizing impulse and greed. At first I was impatient; my chips went to zero several times. It felt like a 0‑to‑1 innovation project: low odds, huge imagination, easy to get addicted.</p>
<p>Later I realized winners on the table share two traits: strong hole cards and bold betting at key moments to win outsized returns. A few bets can double chips and clear the table. It reminded me of Duan Yongping’s line: in familiar, high‑certainty tracks, dare to bet—and bet big. It also reminded me of the “ten punches” theory: you only get ten bets in life, each a tenth of your chips. At least you don’t shoot blindly and bleed energy.</p>
<p>At the table, zeroing out means you can recharge. In life and career, zeroing out costs much more. So after the last recharge, I made a rule: don’t leave the table. That strategy kept me in the game for a long time, and I saw many people bust. I only bet big when the odds were overwhelmingly in my favor. The win rate wasn’t high, but when I won, I won big. Small losses are fine; folding is fine. The truly good outcome only needs to happen once.</p>
<p>In just two days in Hangzhou, I saw more people than I did in the whole past year.</p>
